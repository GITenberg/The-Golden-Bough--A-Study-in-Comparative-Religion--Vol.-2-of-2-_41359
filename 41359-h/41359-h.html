          animal.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some of the
          examples cited above to establish the meaning of the term
          <span class="tei tei-q">“neck”</span> as applied to the last sheaf,
          the corn-spirit appears in animal form as a gander, a goat, a hare,
          a cat, and a fox. This introduces us to a new aspect of the
          corn-spirit, which we must now examine. By doing so we shall not
          only have fresh examples of killing the god, but may hope also to
          clear up some points which remain obscure in the myths and worship
          of Attis, Adonis, Osiris, Dionysus, Demeter, and Virbius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amongst the many
          animals whose forms the corn-spirit is supposed to take are the
          wolf, dog, hare, cock, goose, cat, goat, cow (ox, bull), pig, and
          horse. In one or other of these forms the corn-spirit is believed
          to be present in the corn, and to be caught or killed in the last
          sheaf. As the corn is being cut the animal flees before the
          reapers, and if a reaper is taken ill on the field, he is supposed
          to have stumbled unwittingly on the corn-spirit, who has thus
          punished the profane intruder. It is said <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Rye-wolf has got hold of him,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Harvest-goat has given him a push.”</span> The
          person who cuts the last corn or binds the last sheaf gets the name
          of the animal, as the Rye-wolf, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Rye-sow, the Oats-goat, etc., and retains
          the name sometimes for a year. Also the animal is frequently
          represented by a puppet made out of the last sheaf or of wood,
          flowers, etc., which is carried home amid rejoicings on the last
          harvest waggon. Even where the last sheaf is not made up in animal
          shape, it is often called the Rye-wolf, the Hare, Goat, and so on.
          Generally each kind of crop is supposed to have its special animal,
          which is caught in the last sheaf, and called the Rye-wolf, the
          Barley-wolf, the Oats-wolf, the Pea-wolf, or the Potato-wolf,
          according to the crop; but sometimes the figure of the animal is
          only made up once for all at getting in the last crop of the whole
          harvest. Sometimes the animal is believed to be killed by the last
          stroke of the sickle or scythe. But oftener it is thought to live
          so long as there is corn still unthreshed, and to be caught in the
          last sheaf threshed. Hence the man who gives the last stroke with
          the flail is told that he has got the Corn-sow, the Threshing-dog,
          etc. When the threshing is finished, a puppet is made in the form
          of the animal, and this is carried by the thresher of the last
          sheaf to a neighbouring farm, where the threshing is still going
          on. This again shows that the corn-spirit is believed to live
          wherever the corn is still being threshed. Sometimes the thresher
          of the last sheaf himself represents the animal; and if the people
          of the next farm, who are still threshing, catch him, they treat
          him like the animal he represents, by shutting him up in the
          pig-sty, calling him with the cries commonly addressed to pigs, and
          so forth.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=

          statements will now be illustrated by examples. We begin with the
          corn-spirit conceived <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg
          003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as a wolf or a dog. This conception is common in France, Germany,
          and Slavonic countries. Thus, when the wind sets the corn in
          wave-like motion, the peasants often say, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Wolf is going over, or through, the corn,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Rye-wolf is rushing over the
          field,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the Wolf is in the
          corn,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the mad Dog is in the
          corn,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the big Dog is
          there.”</span><a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
          "#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> When
          children wish to go into the corn-fields to pluck ears or gather
          the blue corn-flowers, they are warned not to do so, for
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the big Dog sits in the corn,”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Wolf sits in the corn, and will tear
          you in pieces,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the Wolf will eat
          you.”</span> The wolf against whom the children are warned is not a
          common wolf, for he is often spoken of as the Corn-wolf, Rye-wolf,
          etc.; thus they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Rye-wolf will
          come and eat you up, children,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Rye-wolf will carry you off,”</span> and so forth.<a id="noteref_3"
          name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> Still
          he has all the outward appearance of a wolf. For in the
          neighbourhood of Feilenhof (East Prussia), when a wolf was seen
          running through a field, the peasants used to watch whether he
          carried his tail in the air or dragged it on the ground. If he
          dragged it on the ground, they went after him, and thanked him for
          bringing them a blessing, and even set tit-bits before him. But if
          he carried his tail high, they cursed him and tried to kill him.
          Here the wolf is the corn-spirit, whose fertilising power is in his
          tail.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both dog and
          wolf appear as embodiments of the corn-spirit in harvest-customs.
          Thus in some parts <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg
          004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of Silesia the person who binds the last sheaf is called the

          "#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> But it
          is in the harvest-customs of the north-east of France that the idea
          of the Corn-dog comes out most clearly. Thus when a harvester,
          through sickness, weariness, or laziness, cannot or will not keep
          up with the reaper in front of him, they say, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The White Dog passed near him,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“he has the White Bitch,”</span> or <span class=

          Lons-le-Saulnier, in the Jura, the last sheaf is called the Bitch.
          In the neighbourhood of Verdun the regular expression for finishing
          the reaping is, <span class="tei tei-q">“They are going to kill the
          Dog;”</span> and at Épinal they say, according to the crop,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We will kill the Wheat-dog, or the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So with the
          wolf. In Germany it is said that <span class="tei tei-q">“The Wolf
          sits in the last sheaf.”</span><a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> In
          some places they call out to the reaper, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Beware of the Wolf;”</span> or they say, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is chasing the Wolf out of the corn.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> The
          last bunch of standing corn is called the Wolf, and the man who
          cuts it <span class="tei tei-q">“has the Wolf.”</span> The last
          sheaf is also called the Wolf; and of the woman who binds it they
          say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Wolf is biting her,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“she has the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          must fetch the Wolf”</span> (out of the corn).<a id="noteref_14"
          name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
          Moreover, she is herself called Wolf and has to bear the name for a
          whole year; sometimes, according to the crop, she is called the
          Rye-wolf or the Potato-wolf.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15"
          href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> In the
          island of Rügen they call out to the woman who binds the last
          sheaf, <span class="tei tei-q">“You're Wolf;”</span> and when she
          comes home she bites the lady of the house and the stewardess, for
          which she receives a large piece of meat. The same woman may be
          Rye-wolf, Wheat-wolf, and Oats-wolf, if she happens to bind the
          last sheaf of rye, wheat, and oats.<a id="noteref_16" name=
          "noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> At
          Buir, in the district of Cologne, it was formerly the custom to
          give to the last sheaf the shape of a wolf. It was kept in the barn
          till all the corn was threshed. Then it was brought to the farmer,
          and he had to sprinkle it with beer or brandy.<a id="noteref_17"
          name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> In
          many places the sheaf called the Wolf is made up in human form and
          dressed in clothes. This indicates a confusion between the
          conceptions of the corn-spirit as theriomorphic (in animal form)
          and as anthropomorphic (in human form).<a id="noteref_18" name=
          "noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a>
          Generally the Wolf is brought home on the last waggon, with joyful
          cries.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=
          "#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the Wolf
          is supposed to hide himself amongst the cut corn in the granary,
          until he is driven out of the last bundle by the strokes of the
          flail. Hence at Wanzleben, near Magdeburg, after the threshing the
          peasants go in procession, leading by a chain a man, who is
          enveloped in the threshed out straw and is called the Wolf.<a id=
          "noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> He
          represents the corn-spirit who has been caught escaping from the
          threshed corn. In Trier it is believed that the Corn-wolf
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name=
          "Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is killed at
          threshing. The men thresh the last sheaf till it is reduced to
          chopped straw. In this way they think that the Corn-wolf who was
          lurking in the last sheaf, has been certainly killed.<a id=
          "noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In France also
          the Corn-wolf appears at harvest. Thus they call out to the reaper
          of the last corn, <span class="tei tei-q">“You will catch the
          Wolf.”</span> Near Chambéry they form a ring round the last
          standing corn, and cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Wolf is in
          there.”</span> In Finisterre, when the reaping draws near an end,
          the harvesters cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is the Wolf; we
          will catch him.”</span> Each takes a swath to reap, and he who
          finishes first calls out, <span class="tei tei-q">“I've caught the
          Wolf.”</span><a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href=
          "#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> In
          Guyenne, when the last corn has been reaped, they lead a wether all
          round the field. It is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Wolf of
          the field.”</span> Its horns are decked with a wreath of flowers
          and corn-ears, and its neck and body are also encircled with
          garlands and ribbons. All the reapers march, singing, behind it.
          Then it is killed on the field. In this part of France the last
          sheaf is called the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">coujoulage</span></span>, which, in the
          patois, means a wether. Hence the killing of the wether represents
          the death of the corn-spirit, considered as present in the last
          sheaf; but two different conceptions of the corn-spirit—as a wolf
          and as a wether—are mixed up together.<a id="noteref_23" name=
          "noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes it
          appears to be thought that the Wolf, caught in the last corn, lives
          during the winter in the farmhouse, ready to renew his activity as
          corn-spirit in the spring. Hence at midwinter, when the lengthening
          days begin to herald the approach of spring, the Wolf makes his
          appearance once more. In Poland a man, with a wolf's skin thrown
          over his head, is led about at Christmas; or a stuffed wolf is
          carried about by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg
          007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          persons who collect money.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> There
          are facts which point to an old custom of leading about a man
          enveloped in leaves and called the Wolf, while his conductors
          collected money.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href=
          "#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another form
          which the corn-spirit often assumes is that of a cock. In Austria
          children are warned against straying in the corn-fields, because
          the Corn-cock sits there, and will peck their eyes out.<a id=

          Cock.”</span> When it is cut they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We
          have caught the Cock.”</span> Then a cock is made of flowers,
          fastened on a pole, and carried home by the reapers, singing as

          lets loose a cock, which he has brought in a basket, and lets it
          run over the field. All the harvesters chase it till they catch it.
          Elsewhere the harvesters all try to seize the last corn cut; he who

          the cock is fastened to the top of a May-tree on the last
          harvest-waggon. Elsewhere a live cock, or a figure of one, is
          attached to a harvest-crown and carried on a pole. In Galicia and
          elsewhere this live cock is fastened to the garland of corn-ears or

          and Picardy, the reapers place a live cock in the corn which is to
          be cut last, and chase it over the field, or bury it up to the neck
          in the ground; afterwards they strike off its head with a sickle or

          many parts of Westphalia, when the harvesters bring the wooden cock
          to the farmer, he gives them a live cock, which they kill with
          whips or sticks, or behead with an old sword, or throw it into the
          barn to the girls, or give it to the mistress to cook. If the
          Harvest-cock has not been spilt—that is, if no waggon has been
          upset—the harvesters have the right of killing the farmyard cock by
          throwing stones at it or beheading it. Where this custom has fallen
          into disuse, it is still common for the farmer's wife to make
          cockie-leekie for the harvesters, and to show them the head of the
          cock which has been killed for the soup.<a id="noteref_38" name=

          stroke. If he fails to do this, he is called the Red Cock for a
          whole year, and people fear that next year's crop will be
          bad.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=

          neighbourhood of Udvarhely, Transylvania, a live cock is bound up
          in the last sheaf and killed with a spit. It is then skinned. The
          flesh is thrown away, but the skin and feathers are kept till next
          year; and in spring the grain from the last sheaf is mixed with the
          feathers of the cock and scattered on the field which is to be

          spirit of the corn. By being tied up in the last sheaf and killed,
          the cock is identified with the corn, and its death with the
          cutting of the corn. By keeping its feathers till spring, then
          mixing them with the seed-corn taken from the very sheaf in which
          the bird had been bound, and scattering the feathers together with
          the seed over the field, the identity of the bird with the corn is
          again emphasised, and its quickening and fertilising power, as the
          corn-spirit, is intimated in the plainest manner. Thus the
          corn-spirit, in the form of a cock, is killed at harvest, but rises
          to fresh life and activity in spring. Again, the equivalence of the
          cock to the corn is expressed, hardly less plainly, in the custom
          of burying the bird in the ground, and cutting off its head (like
          the ears of corn) with the scythe.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“the Cat is caught;”</span> and at threshing, the man
          who gives the last stroke is called the Cat. In the neighbourhood
          of Lyons the last sheaf and the harvest supper are both called the
          Cat. About Vesoul when they cut the last corn they say,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We have the Cat by the tail.”</span> At
          Briançon, in Dauphiné, at the beginning of reaping, a cat is decked
          out with ribbons, flowers, and ears of corn. It is called the Cat
          of the ball-skin (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">le chat de peau de

          the cat lick the wound. At the close of the reaping the cat is
          again decked out with ribbons and ears of corn; then there is
          dancing and merriment. When the dance is over, the cat is solemnly
          stripped of its ornaments by the girls. At Grüneberg in Silesia the
          reaper who cuts the last corn is called the Tom-cat. He is
          enveloped in rye-stalks and green withes, and is furnished with a
          long plaited tail. Sometimes as a companion he has a man similarly
          dressed, who is called the (female) Cat. Their duty is to run after
          people whom they see and beat them with a long stick. Near Amiens

          to kill the Cat;”</span> and when the last corn is cut a cat is
          killed in the farmyard. At threshing, in some parts of France, a
          live cat is placed under the last bundle of corn to be threshed,
          and is struck dead with the flails. Then on Sunday it is roasted
          and eaten as a holiday dish.</p>

          his allotted patch to reap. When a harvester in the middle has not
          finished reaping his piece after his neighbours have finished
          theirs, they say of him, <span class="tei tei-q">“He remains on the
          island.”</span> And if the laggard is a man, they imitate the cry
          with which they call a he-goat; if a woman, the cry with which they

          are set up on the last heap of corn, and it is called <span class=

          are inserted in its nostrils and mouth, and it is adorned with
          garlands of flowers. It is set upon the field and called the
          Oats-goat. When the reaping approaches an end, each reaper hastens
          to finish his piece first; he who is the last to finish gets the

          hung round his neck, is led in triumph, and drenched with liquor.
          In parts of Styria, also, the man who cuts the last corn is called
          Corn-goat, Oats-goat, etc. As a rule, the man who thus gets the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to one
          view, the corn-spirit, who has been caught in the form of a goat or
          otherwise, lives in the farmhouse or barn over winter. Thus, each
          farm has its own embodiment of the corn-spirit. But, according to
          another view, the corn-spirit is the genius or deity, not of the
          corn of one farm only, but of all the corn. Hence when the corn on
          one farm is all cut, he flees to another where there is still corn
          left standing. This idea is brought out in a harvest-custom which
          was formerly observed in Skye. The farmer who first finished
          reaping sent a man or woman with a sheaf to a neighbouring farmer
          who had not finished; the latter in his turn, when he had finished,
          sent on the sheaf to his neighbour who was still reaping; and so
          the sheaf made the round of the farms till all the corn was cut.
          The sheaf was called the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> crippled by the

          the loser in the race, and at night they come and erect on the roof
          of his house the Oats-goat, which is a colossal figure of a goat
          made of straw.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href=
          "#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But sometimes
          the corn-spirit, in the form of a goat, is believed to be slain on
          the harvest-field by the sickle or scythe. Thus, in the
          neighbourhood of Bernkastel, on the Moselle, the reapers determine
          by lot the order in which they shall follow each other. The first
          is called the fore-reaper, the last the tail-bearer. If a reaper
          overtakes the man in front he reaps past him, bending round so as
          to leave the slower reaper in a patch by himself. This patch is
          called the Goat; and the man for whom <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Goat is cut”</span> in this way, is laughed and jeered at by his
          fellows for the rest of the day. When the tail-bearer cuts the last
          ears of corn, it is said <span class="tei tei-q">“He is cutting the
          Goat's neck off.”</span><a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href=
          "#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> In the
          neighbourhood of Grenoble, before the end of the reaping, a live
          goat is adorned with flowers and ribbons and allowed to run about
          the field. The reapers chase it and try to catch it. When it is
          caught, the farmer's wife holds it fast while the farmer cuts off
          its head. The goat's flesh serves to furnish the harvest supper. A
          piece of the flesh is pickled and kept till the next harvest, when
          another goat is killed. Then all the harvesters eat <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the flesh. On the same day the skin
          of the goat is made into a cloak, which the farmer, who works with
          his men, must always wear at harvest-time if rain or bad weather
          sets in. But if a reaper gets pains in his back, the farmer gives
          him the goat-skin to wear.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66"
          href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> The
          reason for this seems to be that the pains in the back, being
          inflicted by the corn-spirit, can also be healed by it. Similarly
          we saw that elsewhere, when a reaper is wounded at reaping, a cat,
          as the representative of the corn-spirit, is made to lick the
          wound.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href=
          "#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>
          Esthonian reapers in the island of Mon think that the man who cuts
          the first ears of corn at harvest will get pains in his back,<a id=
          "noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a>—probably
          because the corn-spirit is believed to resent especially the first
          wound; and, in order to escape pains in the back, Saxon reapers in
          Transylvania gird their loins with the first handful of ears which
          they cut.<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href=
          "#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> Here,
          again, the corn-spirit is applied to for healing or protection, but
          in his original vegetable form, not in the form of a goat or a
          cat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, the
          corn-spirit under the form of a goat is sometimes conceived as
          lurking among the cut corn in the barn, till he is driven from it
          by the threshing-flail. For example, in the neighbourhood of Marktl
          in Upper Bavaria the sheaves are called Straw-goats or simply
          Goats. They are laid in a great heap on the open field and threshed
          by two rows of men standing opposite each other, who, as they ply
          their flails, sing a song in which they say that they see the
          Straw-goat amongst the corn-stalks. The last Goat, that is, the
          last sheaf, is adorned with a wreath of violets and other
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name=
          "Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> flowers and with
          cakes strung together. It is placed right in the middle of the
          heap. Some of the threshers rush at it and tear the best of it out;
          others lay on with their flails so recklessly that heads are
          sometimes broken. In threshing this last sheaf, each man casts up
          to the man opposite him the misdeeds of which he has been guilty
          throughout the year.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href=
          "#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> At
          Oberinntal in Tyrol the last thresher is called Goat.<a id=
          "noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a> At
          Tettnang in Würtemberg the thresher who gives the last stroke to
          the last bundle of corn before it is turned goes by the name of the
          He-goat, and it is said <span class="tei tei-q">“he has driven the
          He-goat away.”</span> The person who, after the bundle has been
          turned, gives the last stroke of all, is called the She-goat.<a id=
          "noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> In
          this custom it is implied that the corn is inhabited by a pair of
          corn-spirits, male and female. Further, the corn-spirit, captured
          in the form of a goat at threshing, is passed on to a neighbour
          whose threshing is not yet finished. In Franche Comté, as soon as
          the threshing is over, the young people set up a straw figure of a
          goat on the farmyard of a neighbour who is still threshing. He must
          give them wine or money in return. At Ellwangen in Würtemberg the
          effigy of a goat is made out of the last bundle of corn at
          threshing; four sticks form its legs, and two its horns. The man
          who gives the last stroke with the flail must carry the Goat to the
          barn of a neighbour who is still threshing and throw it down on the
          floor; if he is caught in the act, they tie the Goat on his
          back.<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href=
          "#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> A
          similar custom is observed at Indersdorf in Upper Bavaria; the man
          who throws the straw Goat into the neighbour's barn imitates the
          bleating of a goat; if they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> catch him they blacken his face and tie the
          Goat on his back.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href=
          "#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> At
          Zabern in Elsass, when a farmer is a week or more behind his
          neighbours with his threshing, they set a real stuffed goat (or
          fox) before his door.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href=
          "#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>
          Sometimes the spirit of the corn in goat form is believed to be
          killed at threshing. In the district of Traunstein, Upper Bavaria,
          it is thought that the Oats-goat is in the last sheaf of oats. He
          is represented by an old rake set up on end, with an old pot for a
          head. The children are then told to kill the Oats-goat.<a id=
          "noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> A
          stranger passing a harvest-field is sometimes taken for the
          Corn-goat escaping in human shape from the cut or threshed grain.
          Thus, when a stranger passes a harvest-field, all the labourers
          stop and shout as with one voice <span class="tei tei-q">“He-goat!
          He-goat!”</span> At rape-seed threshing in Schleswig, which
          generally takes place on the field, the same cry is raised if the
          stranger does not take off his hat.<a id="noteref_77" name=
          "noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At sowing their
          winter corn the Prussian Slavs used to kill a goat, consume its
          flesh with many superstitious ceremonies, and hang the skin on a
          high pole near an oak and a large stone. Here it remained till
          harvest. Then, after a prayer had been offered by a peasant who
          acted as priest (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Weidulut</span></span>) the young folk joined
          hands and danced round the oak and the pole. Afterwards they
          scrambled for the bunch of corn, and the priest distributed the
          herbs with a sparing hand. Then he placed the goat-skin on the
          large stone, sat down on it and preached to the people about the
          history of their forefathers and their old heathen customs and
          beliefs.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href=
          "#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> The
          goat-skin thus suspended <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg
          019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          on the field from sowing time to harvest represents the corn-spirit
          superintending the growth of the corn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another form
          which the corn-spirit often assumes is that of a bull, cow, or ox.
          When the wind sweeps over the corn they say at Conitz in West
          Prussia, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Steer is running in the
          corn;”</span><a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href=
          "#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> when
          the corn is thick and strong in one spot, they say in some parts of
          East Prussia, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Bull is lying in the
          corn.”</span> When a harvester has overstrained and lamed himself,
          they say in the Graudenz district (West Prussia), <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Bull pushed him;”</span> in Lothringen they say,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He has the Bull.”</span> The meaning of
          both expressions is that he has unwittingly lighted upon the divine
          corn-spirit, who has punished the profane intruder with
          lameness.<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href=
          "#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> So
          near Chambéry when a reaper wounds himself with his sickle, it is
          said that he has <span class="tei tei-q">“the wound of the
          Ox.”</span><a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=
          "#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> In the
          district of Bunzlau the last sheaf is sometimes made into the shape
          of a horned ox, stuffed with tow and wrapt in corn-ears. This
          figure is called the Old Man (<span lang="de" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">der Alte</span></span>). In some parts of
          Bohemia the last sheaf is made up in human form and called the
          Buffalo-bull.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href=
          "#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> These
          cases show a confusion between the anthropomorphic and the
          theriomorphic conception of the corn-spirit. The confusion is
          parallel to that of killing a wether under the name of a
          wolf.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href=
          "#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Canton of Thurgau, Switzerland, the last sheaf, if it is a large
          one, is called the Cow.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href=
          "#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> All
          over Swabia the last bundle of corn on the field is called the Cow;
          the man who cuts the last ears <span class="tei tei-q">“has the
          Cow,”</span> and is himself called Cow or Barley-cow or Oats-cow,
          according to the crop; at the harvest supper he gets a nosegay of
          flowers and corn-ears and a more liberal allowance of drink than
          the rest. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg
          020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          But he is teased and laughed at; so no one likes to be the
          Cow.<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href=
          "#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> The
          Cow was sometimes represented by the figure of a woman made out of
          ears of corn and corn-flowers. It was carried to the farmhouse by
          the man who had cut the last handful of corn. The children ran
          after him and the neighbours turned out to laugh at him, till the
          farmer took the Cow from him.<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86"
          href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> Here
          again the confusion between the human and the animal form of the
          corn-spirit is apparent. In various parts of Switzerland the reaper
          who cuts the last ears of corn is called Wheat-cow, Corn-cow,
          Oats-cow, or Corn-steer, and is the butt of many a joke.<a id=
          "noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> In
          some parts of East Prussia, when a few ears of corn have been left
          standing by inadvertence on the last swath, the foremost reaper
          seizes them and cries, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bull!
          Bull!”</span><a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href=
          "#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> On the
          other hand, in the district of Rosenheim, in Upper Bavaria, when a
          farmer is later in getting in his harvest than his neighbours, they
          set up on his land a Straw-bull, as it is called. This is a
          gigantic figure of a bull made of stubble on a framework of wood
          and adorned with flowers and leaves. A label is attached to it
          containing doggerel verses in ridicule of the man on whose land the
          Straw-bull is placed.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href=
          "#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          corn-spirit in the form of a bull or ox is killed on the
          harvest-field at the close of the reaping. At Pouilly near Dijon,
          when the last ears of corn are about to be cut, an ox adorned with
          ribbons, flowers, and ears of corn is led all round the field,
          followed by the whole troop of reapers dancing. Then a man
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name=
          "Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> disguised as the
          Devil cuts the last ears of corn and immediately kills the ox. Part
          of the flesh of the animal is eaten at the harvest supper; part is
          pickled and kept till the first day of sowing in spring. At Pont à
          Mousson and elsewhere on the evening of the last day of reaping a
          calf adorned with flowers and ears of corn is led three times round
          the farmyard, being allured by a bait or driven by men with sticks,
          or conducted by the farmer's wife with a rope. The calf selected
          for this ceremony is the calf which was born first on the farm in
          the spring of the year. It is followed by all the reapers with
          their implements. Then it is allowed to run free; the reapers chase
          it, and whoever catches it is called King of the Calf. Lastly, it
          is solemnly killed; at Lunéville the man who acts as butcher is the
          Jewish merchant of the village.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes again
          the corn-spirit hides himself amongst the cut corn in the barn to
          reappear in bull or cow form at threshing. Thus at Wurmlingen in
          Thüringen the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is called
          the Cow, or rather the Barley-cow, Oats-cow, Peas-cow, etc.,
          according to the crop. He is entirely enveloped in straw; his head
          is surmounted by sticks in imitation of horns, and two lads lead
          him by ropes to the well to drink. On the way thither he must low
          like a cow, and for a long time afterwards he goes by the name of
          the Cow.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=

          again, we are met with that confusion between the anthropomorphic
          and theriomorphic conception of the corn-spirit, which has been
          already signalised. In Canton Schaffhausen the man who threshes the
          last corn is called the Cow; in Canton Thurgau, the Corn-bull; in
          Canton Zurich, the Thresher-cow. In the last-mentioned district he
          is wrapt in straw and bound to one of the trees in the
          orchard.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href=
          "#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> At
          Arad in Hungary the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is
          enveloped in straw and a cow's hide with the horns attached to
          it.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href=
          "#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a> At
          Pessnitz, in the district of Dresden, the man who gives the last
          stroke with the flail is called Bull. He must make a straw-man and
          set it up before a neighbour's window.<a id="noteref_95" name=
          "noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> Here,
          apparently, as in so many cases, the corn-spirit is passed on to a
          neighbour who has not finished threshing. So at Herbrechtingen in
          Thüringen the effigy of a ragged old woman is flung into the barn
          of the farmer who is last with his threshing. The man who throws it
          in cries, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is the Cow for
          you.”</span> If the threshers catch him they detain him over night
          and punish him by keeping him from the harvest supper.<a id=
          "noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> In
          these latter customs the confusion between the anthropomorphic and
          theriomorphic conception of the corn-spirit meets us again.
          Further, the corn-spirit in bull form is sometimes believed to be
          killed at threshing. At Auxerre in threshing the last bundle of
          corn they call out twelve times, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are
          killing the Bull.”</span> In <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the neighbourhood of Bordeaux, where a
          butcher kills an ox on the field immediately after the close of the
          reaping, it is said of the man who gives the last stroke at
          threshing that <span class="tei tei-q">“he has killed the
          Bull.”</span><a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href=
          "#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a> At
          Chambéry the last sheaf is called the sheaf of the Young Ox and a
          race takes place to it, in which all the reapers join. When the
          last stroke is given at threshing they say that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Ox is killed;”</span> and immediately thereupon a
          real ox is slaughtered by the reaper who cut the last corn. The
          flesh of the ox is eaten by the threshers at supper.<a id=
          "noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that sometimes the young corn-spirit, whose task it is to quicken
          the corn of the coming year, is believed to be born as a Corn-baby
          on the harvest-field.<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href=
          "#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>
          Similarly in Berry the young corn-spirit is sometimes believed to
          be born on the field in calf form. For when a binder has not rope
          enough to bind all the corn in sheaves, he puts aside the wheat
          that remains over and imitates the lowing of a cow. The meaning is
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“the sheaf has given birth to a
          calf.”</span><a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href=
          "#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> In
          Puy-de-Dôme when a binder cannot keep up with the reaper whom he or
          she follows, they say <span class="tei tei-q">“He or she is giving
          birth to the Calf.”</span><a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101"
          href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> In
          some parts of Prussia, in similar circumstances, they call out to
          the woman, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Bull is coming,”</span> and
          imitate the bellowing of a bull.<a id="noteref_102" name=
          "noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a> In
          these cases the woman is conceived as the Corn-cow or old
          corn-spirit, while the supposed calf is the Corn-calf or young
          corn-spirit. In some parts of Austria a mythical calf (<span lang=
          "de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Muhkälbchen</span></span>) is believed to be
          seen amongst the sprouting corn in spring and to push the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name=
          "Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> children; when the
          corn waves in the wind they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Calf
          is going about.”</span> Clearly, as Mannhardt observes, this calf
          of the spring-time is the same animal which is afterwards believed
          to be killed at reaping.<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103"
          href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
          corn-spirit appears in the shape of a horse or mare. Between Kalw
          and Stuttgart, when the corn bends before the wind, they say,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“There runs the Horse.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> In
          Hertfordshire, at the end of the reaping, there is or was a
          ceremony called <span class="tei tei-q">“crying the Mare.”</span>
          The last blades of corn left standing on the field are tied
          together and called the Mare. The reapers stand at a distance and
          throw their sickles at it; he who cuts it through <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“has the prize, with acclamations and good
          cheer.”</span> After it is cut the reapers cry thrice with a loud
          voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have her!”</span> Others answer
          thrice, <span class="tei tei-q">“What have
          you?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“A Mare! a Mare! a
          Mare!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Whose is she?”</span> is
          next asked thrice. <span class="tei tei-q">“A. B.'s,”</span> naming
          the owner thrice. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whither will you send
          her?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“To C. D.,”</span> naming some
          neighbour who has not all his corn reaped.<a id="noteref_105" name=
          "noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> In
          this custom the corn-spirit in the form of a mare is passed on from
          a farm where the corn is all cut to another farm where it is still
          standing, and where therefore the corn-spirit may be supposed
          naturally to take refuge. In Shropshire the custom is similar.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Crying, calling, or shouting the mare is a
          ceremony performed by the men of that farm which is the first in
          any parish or district to finish the harvest. The object of it is
          to make known their own prowess, and to taunt the laggards by a
          pretended offer of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘owd mar’</span>
          [old mare] to help out their <span class="tei tei-q">‘chem’</span>
          [team]. All the men assemble (the wooden harvest-bottle being of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The farmer who
          finishes his harvest last, and who therefore cannot send the Mare
          to any one else, is said <span class="tei tei-q">“to keep her all
          winter.”</span> The mocking offer of the Mare was sometimes
          responded to by a mocking acceptance of her help. Thus an old man
          told an inquirer, <span class="tei tei-q">“While we wun at supper,
          a mon cumm'd wi' a autar [halter] to fatch her away.”</span> But at
          one place (Longnor, near Leebotwood), down to about 1850, the Mare
          used really to be sent. <span class="tei tei-q">“The head man of
          the farmer who had finished harvest first was mounted on the best
          horse of the team—the leader—both horse and man being adorned with
          ribbons, streamers, etc. Thus arrayed, a boy on foot led the pair
          in triumph to the neighbouring farmhouses. Sometimes the man who
          took the <span class="tei tei-q">‘mare’</span> received, as well as
          plenty of harvest-ale, some rather rough, though good-humoured,
          treatment, coming back minus his decorations, and so
          on.”</span><a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href=
          "#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> In
          the neighbourhood of Lille the idea of the corn-spirit <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in horse form is clearly preserved.
          When a harvester grows weary at his work, it is said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He has the fatigue of the Horse.”</span> The first
          sheaf, called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Cross of the
          Horse,”</span> is placed on a cross of box-wood in the barn, and
          the youngest horse on the farm must tread on it. The reapers dance
          round the last blades of corn, crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“See
          the remains of the Horse.”</span> The sheaf made out of these last
          blades is given to the youngest horse of the parish (commune) to
          eat. This youngest horse of the parish clearly represents, as
          Mannhardt says, the corn-spirit of the following year, the
          Corn-foal, which absorbs the spirit of the old Corn-horse by eating
          the last corn cut; for, as usual, the old corn-spirit takes his
          final refuge in the last sheaf. The thresher of the last sheaf is
          said to <span class="tei tei-q">“beat the Horse.”</span><a id=

          Again, a trace of the horse-shaped corn-spirit is reported from
          Berry. The harvesters there are accustomed to take a noon-day sleep
          in the field. This is called <span class="tei tei-q">“seeing the
          Horse.”</span> The leader or <span class="tei tei-q">“King”</span>
          of the harvesters gives the signal for going to sleep. If he delays
          giving the signal, one of the harvesters will begin to neigh like a
          horse, the rest imitate him, and then they all go <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to see the Horse.”</span><a id="noteref_108" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last animal
          embodiment of the corn-spirit which we shall notice is the pig
          (boar or sow). In Thüringen, when the wind sets the young corn in
          motion, they sometimes say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Boar is

          Amongst the Esthonians of the island of Oesel the last sheaf is

          distinction by passing on to a neighbour the straw-rope, which is

          028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          carries to a neighbouring farm where the threshing is not finished,
          and throws it into the barn. If the threshers catch him they handle
          him roughly, beating him, blackening or dirtying his face, throwing
          him into filth, binding the Sow on his back, etc.; if the bearer of
          the Sow is a woman they cut off her hair. At the harvest supper or
          dinner the man who <span class="tei tei-q">“carried the Pig”</span>
          gets one or more dumplings made in the form of pigs; sometimes he
          gets a large dumpling and a number of small ones, all in pig form,
          the large one being called the sow and the small ones the
          sucking-pigs. Sometimes he has the right to be the first to put his
          hand into the dish and take out as many small dumplings
          (<span class="tei tei-q">“sucking-pigs”</span>) as he can, while
          the other threshers strike at his hand with spoons or sticks. When
          the dumplings are served up by the maid-servant, all the people at
          table cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“Süz, süz, süz!”</span> being
          the cry used in calling pigs. Sometimes after dinner the man who
          <span class="tei tei-q">“carried the Pig”</span> has his face
          blackened, and is set on a cart and drawn round the village by his
          fellows, followed by a crowd crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Süz,
          süz, süz!”</span> as if they were calling swine. Sometimes, after
          being wheeled round the village, he is flung on the dunghill.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          corn-spirit in the form of a pig plays his part at sowing-time as
          well as at harvest. At Neuautz, in Courland, when barley is sown
          for the first time in the year, the farmer's wife boils the chine
          of a pig along with the tail, and brings it to the sower on the
          field. He eats of it, but cuts off the tail and sticks it in the
          field; it is believed that the ears of corn will then grow as long
          as the tail.<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href=

          pig he is put in the ground at sowing-time, and as a pig he
          reappears amongst the ripe corn at harvest. For amongst the
          neighbouring Esthonians, as we have seen,<a id="noteref_119" name=

          last sheaf is called the Rye-boar. Somewhat similar customs are
          observed in Germany. In the Salza district, near Meiningen, a
          certain bone in the pig is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Jew
          on the winnowing-fan”</span> (<span lang="de" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">der Jud' auf der Wanne</span></span>). The
          flesh of this bone is boiled on Shrove Tuesday, but the bone is put
          amongst the ashes, which the neighbours exchange as presents on St.
          Peter's Day (22d February), and then mix with the seed-corn.<a id=

          the whole of Hessen, Meiningen, etc., people eat pea-soup with
          dried pig-ribs on Ash Wednesday or Candlemas. The ribs are then
          collected and hung in the room till sowing-time, when they are
          inserted in the sown field or in the seed-bag amongst the flax
          seed. This is thought to be an infallible specific against
          earth-fleas and moles, and to cause the flax to grow well and
          tall.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href=

          many parts of White Russia people eat a roast lamb or sucking-pig

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          conception of the corn-spirit as embodied in pig form is nowhere
          more clearly expressed than in the Scandinavian custom of the Yule
          Boar. In Sweden and Denmark at Yule (Christmas) it is the custom to
          bake a loaf in the form of a boar-pig. This is called <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Yule Boar. The corn of the last
          sheaf is often used to make it. All through Yule the Yule Boar
          stands on the table. Often it is kept till the sowing-time in
          spring, when part of it is mixed with the seed-corn and part given
          to the ploughmen and plough-horses or plough-oxen to eat, in the
          expectation of a good harvest.<a id="noteref_123" name=
          "noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> In
          this custom the corn-spirit, immanent in the last sheaf, appears at
          midwinter in the form of a boar made from the corn of the last
          sheaf; and his quickening influence on the corn is shown by mixing
          part of the Yule Boar with the seed-corn, and giving part of it to
          the ploughman and his cattle to eat. Similarly we saw that the
          Corn-wolf makes his appearance at midwinter, the time when the year
          begins to verge towards spring.<a id="noteref_124" name=
          "noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> We
          may conjecture that the Yule straw, of which Swedish peasants make
          various superstitious uses, comes, in part at least, from the sheaf
          out of which the Yule Boar is made. The Yule straw is long
          rye-straw, a portion of which is always set apart for this season.
          It is strewn over the floor at Christmas, and the peasants
          attribute many virtues to it. For example, they think that some of
          it scattered on the ground will make a barren field productive.
          Again, the peasant at Christmas seats himself on a log; his eldest
          son or daughter, or the mother herself, if the children are not old
          enough, places a wisp of the Yule straw on his knee. From this he
          draws out single straws, and throws them, one by one, up to the
          ceiling; and as many as lodge in the rafters, so many will be the
          sheaves of rye he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg
          031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a>
          Again, it is only the Yule straw which may be used in binding the
          fruit-trees as a charm to fertilise them.<a id="noteref_126" name=
          "noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a> These
          uses of the Yule straw show that it is believed to possess
          fertilising virtues analogous to those ascribed to the Yule Boar;
          the conjecture is therefore legitimate that the Yule straw is made
          from the same sheaf as the Yule Boar. Formerly a real boar was
          sacrificed at Christmas,<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127"
          href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> and
          apparently also a man in the character of the Yule Boar. This, at
          least, may perhaps be inferred from a Christmas custom still
          observed in Sweden. A man is wrapt up in a skin, and carries a wisp
          of straw in his mouth, so that the projecting straws look like the
          bristles of a boar. A knife is brought, and an old woman, with her
          face blackened, pretends to sacrifice the man.<a id="noteref_128"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for the
          animal embodiments of the corn-spirit as they are presented to us
          in the folk-customs of Northern Europe. These customs bring out
          clearly the sacramental character of the harvest supper. The
          corn-spirit is conceived as embodied in an animal; this divine
          animal is slain, and its flesh and blood are partaken of by the
          harvesters. Thus, the cock, the goose, the hare, the cat, the goat,
          and the ox are eaten sacramentally by the harvesters, and the pig
          is eaten sacramentally by ploughmen in spring.<a id="noteref_129"

          Again, as a substitute for the real flesh of the divine being,
          bread or dumplings are made in his image and eaten sacramentally;
          thus, pig-shaped dumplings are eaten by the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> harvesters, and loaves made in
          boar-shape (the Yule Boar) are eaten in spring by the ploughman and
          his cattle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader has
          probably remarked the complete parallelism between the
          anthropomorphic and the theriomorphic conceptions of the
          corn-spirit. The parallel may be here briefly resumed. When the
          corn waves in the wind it is said either that the Corn-mother or
          that the Corn-wolf, etc. is passing through the corn. Children are
          warned against straying in corn-fields either because the
          Corn-mother or because the Corn-wolf, etc. is there. In the last
          corn cut or the last sheaf threshed either the Corn-mother or the
          Corn-wolf, etc. is supposed to be present. The last sheaf is itself
          called either the Corn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., and is made
          up in the shape either of a woman or of a wolf, etc. The person who
          cuts, binds, or threshes the last sheaf is called either the Old
          Woman or the Wolf, etc., according to the name bestowed on the
          sheaf itself. As in some places a sheaf made in human form and
          called the Maiden, the Mother of the Maize, etc. is kept from one
          harvest to the next in order to secure a continuance of the
          corn-spirit's blessing; so in some places the Harvest-cock and in
          others the flesh of the goat is kept for a similar purpose from one
          harvest to the next. As in some places the grain taken from the
          Corn-mother is mixed with the seed-corn in spring to make the crop
          abundant; so in some places the feathers of the cock, and in Sweden
          the Yule Boar is kept till spring and mixed with the seed-corn for
          a like purpose. As part of the Corn-mother or Maiden is given to
          the cattle to eat in order that they may thrive, so part of the
          Yule Boar is given to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg
          033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          ploughing horses or oxen in spring. Lastly, the death of the
          corn-spirit is represented by killing (in reality or pretence)
          either his human or his animal representative; and the worshippers
          partake sacramentally either of the actual body and blood of the
          representative (human or animal) of the divinity, or of bread made
          in his likeness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other animal
          forms assumed by the corn-spirit are the stag, roe, sheep, bear,
          ass, fox, mouse, stork, swan, and kite.<a id="noteref_130" name=
          "noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> If it
          is asked why the corn-spirit should be thought to appear in the
          form of an animal and of so many different animals, we may reply
          that to primitive man the simple appearance of an animal or bird
          among the corn is probably sufficient of itself to suggest a
          mysterious connection between the animal or bird and the corn; and
          when we remember that in the old days, before fields were fenced
          in, all kinds of animals must have been free to roam over them, we
          need not wonder that the corn-spirit should have been identified
          even with large animals like the horse and cow, which nowadays
          could not, except by a rare accident, be found straying among the
          corn. This explanation applies with peculiar force to the very
          common case in which the animal embodiment of the corn-spirit is
          believed to lurk in the last standing corn. For at harvest a number
          of wild animals—hares, rabbits, partridges, etc.—are commonly
          driven by the progress of the reaping into the last patch of
          standing corn, and make their escape from it as it is being cut
          down. So regularly does this happen that reapers and others often
          stand round the last patch of corn armed with sticks or guns, with
          which they kill the animals as they dart out of their last refuge
          among the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg
          034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          corn. Now, primitive man, to whom magical changes of shape seem
          perfectly credible, finds it most natural that the spirit of the
          corn, driven from his home amongst the corn, should make his escape
          in the form of the animal which is seen to rush out of the last
          patch of corn as it falls under the scythe of the reaper. Thus the
          identification of the corn-spirit with an animal is analogous to
          the identification of him with a passing stranger. As the sudden
          appearance of a stranger near the harvest-field or threshing-floor
          is, to the primitive mind, sufficient to identify him as the spirit
          of the corn escaping from the cut or threshed corn, so the sudden
          appearance of an animal issuing from the cut corn is enough to
          identify it with the corn-spirit escaping from his ruined home. The
          two identifications are so analogous that they can hardly be
          dissociated in any attempt to explain them. Those who look to some
          other principle than the one here suggested for the explanation of
          the latter identification are bound to show that their explanation
          covers the former identification also.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But however we
          may explain it, the fact remains that in peasant folk-lore the
          corn-spirit is very commonly conceived and represented in animal
          form. May not this fact explain the relation in which certain
          animals stood to the ancient deities of vegetation, Dionysus,
          Demeter, Adonis, Attis, and Osiris?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To begin with
          Dionysus. We have seen that he was represented sometimes as a goat
          and sometimes as a bull. As a goat he can hardly be separated from
          the minor divinities, the Pans, Satyrs, and Silenuses, all of whom
          are closely associated with him and are represented more or less
          completely in the form of goats. Thus, Pan was regularly
          represented in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg

          Further, the Fauns, the Italian counterpart of the Greek Pans and

          Again, all these minor goat-formed divinities partake more or less

          their character as such is still further brought out by their
          association, or even identification, with Silvanus and the
          Silvanuses, who, as their name of itself indicates, are spirits of
          the woods.<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href=

          Lastly, the association of the Satyrs with the Silenuses, Fauns,
          and Silvanuses,<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href=
          "#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a>
          proves that the Satyrs also were woodland deities. These
          goat-formed spirits of the woods have their counterparts in the
          folk-lore of Northern Europe. Thus, the Russian wood-spirits,
          called <span lang="ru" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "ru"><span style="font-style: italic">Ljeschie</span></span> (from
          <span lang="ru" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ru"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ljes</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“wood,”</span>) are believed to appear partly in human
          shape, but with the horns, ears, and legs of goats. The <span lang=
          "ru" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ru"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ljeschi</span></span> can alter his stature at
          pleasure; when he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg
          036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          walks in the wood he is as tall as the trees; when he walks in the
          meadows he is no higher than the grass. Some of the <span lang="ru"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ru"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ljeschie</span></span> are spirits of the corn
          as well as of the wood; before harvest they are as tall as the
          corn-stalks, but after it they shrink to the height of the
          stubble.<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href=
          "#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> This
          brings out—what we have remarked before—the close connection
          between tree-spirits and corn-spirits, and shows how easily the
          former may melt into the latter. Similarly the Fauns, though
          wood-spirits, were believed to foster the growth of the
          crops.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href=
          "#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> We
          have already seen how often the corn-spirit is represented in
          folk-custom as a goat.<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href=
          "#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> On
          the whole, then, as Mannhardt argues,<a id="noteref_145" name=
          "noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> the
          Pans, Satyrs, and Fauns appear to belong to a widely diffused class
          of wood-spirits conceived in goat-form. The fondness of goats for
          straying in woods and nibbling the bark of trees—to which it is
          well known that they are most destructive—is an obvious and perhaps
          sufficient reason why wood-spirits should so often be supposed to
          take the form of goats. The inconsistency of a god of vegetation
          subsisting upon the vegetation which he personifies is not one to
          strike the primitive mind. Such inconsistencies arise when the
          deity, ceasing to be immanent in the vegetation, comes to be
          regarded as its owner or lord; for the idea of owning the
          vegetation naturally leads to that of subsisting on it. We have
          already seen that the corn-spirit, originally conceived as immanent
          in the corn, afterwards comes to be regarded as its owner, who
          lives on it and is reduced to poverty and want by being deprived of
          it.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href=
          "#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
          representation of wood-spirits in goat-form appears to be both
          widespread and, to the primitive <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> mind, natural. Therefore when we find, as we
          have done, that Dionysus—a tree-god—is sometimes represented in
          goat form,<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href=
          "#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> we
          can hardly avoid concluding that this representation is simply a
          part of his proper character as a tree-god and is not to be
          explained by the fusion of two distinct and independent cults, in
          one of which he originally appeared as a tree-god and in the other
          as a goat. If such a fusion took place in the case of Dionysus, it
          must equally have taken place in the case of the Pans and Satyrs of
          Greece, the Fauns of Italy, and the <span lang="ru" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ru"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ljeschie</span></span> of Russia. That such a
          fusion of two wholly disconnected cults should have occurred once
          is possible; that it should have occurred twice independently is
          improbable; that it should have occurred thrice independently is so
          unlikely as to be practically incredible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dionysus was
          also represented, as we have seen,<a id="noteref_148" name=
          "noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> in
          the form of a bull. After what has gone before we are naturally led
          to expect that his bull form must have been only another expression
          for his character as a deity of vegetation, especially as the bull
          is a common embodiment of the corn-spirit in Northern Europe;<a id=
          "noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> and
          the close association of Dionysus with Demeter and Proserpine in
          the mysteries of Eleusis shows that he had at least strong
          agricultural affinities. The other possible explanation of the
          bull-shaped Dionysus would be that the conception of him as a bull
          was originally entirely distinct from the conception of him as a
          deity of vegetation, and that the fusion of the two conceptions was
          due to some such circumstance as the union of two tribes, one of
          which had previously worshipped a bull-god and the other a
          tree-god. This appears to be the view taken by Mr. Andrew Lang, who
          suggests that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg
          038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the bull-formed Dionysus <span class="tei tei-q">“had either been
          developed out of, or had succeeded to the worship of a
          bull-totem.”</span><a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href=
          "#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a> Of
          course this is possible. But it is not yet certain that the Aryans
          ever had totemism. On the other hand, it is quite certain that many
          Aryan peoples have conceived deities of vegetation as embodied in
          animal forms. Therefore when we find amongst an Aryan people like
          the Greeks a deity of vegetation represented as an animal, the
          presumption must be in favour of explaining this by a principle
          which is certainly known to have influenced the Aryan race rather
          than by one which is not certainly known to have done so. In the
          present state of our knowledge, therefore, it is safer to regard
          the bull form of Dionysus as being, like his goat form, an
          expression of his proper character as a deity of vegetation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The probability
          of this view will be somewhat increased if it can be shown that in
          other rites than those of Dionysus the ancients slew an ox as a
          representative of the spirit of vegetation. This they appear to
          have done in the Athenian sacrifice known as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the murder of the ox”</span> (<span lang="el" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bouphonia</span></span>). It took place about
          the end of June or beginning of July, that is, about the time when
          the threshing is nearly over in Attica. According to tradition the
          sacrifice was instituted to procure a cessation of drought and
          barrenness which had afflicted the land. The ritual was as follows.
          Barley mixed with wheat, or cakes made of them, were laid upon the
          bronze altar of Zeus Polieus on the Acropolis. Oxen were driven
          round the altar, and the ox which went up to the altar and ate the
          offering on it was sacrificed. The axe and knife with which the
          beast was slain had been previously wetted with water brought
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name=
          "Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by maidens called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“water-carriers.”</span> The weapons were
          then sharpened and handed to the butchers, one of whom felled the
          ox with the axe and another cut its throat with the knife. As soon
          as he had felled the ox, the former threw the axe from him and
          fled; and the man who cut the beast's throat apparently imitated
          his example. Meantime the ox was skinned and all present partook of
          its flesh. Then the hide was stuffed with straw and sewed up; next
          the stuffed animal was set on its feet and yoked to a plough as if
          it were ploughing. A trial then took place in an ancient law-court
          presided over by the King (as he was called) to determine who had
          murdered the ox. The maidens who had brought the water accused the
          men who had sharpened the axe and knife; the men who had sharpened
          the axe and knife blamed the men who had handed these implements to
          the butchers; the men who had handed the implements to the butchers
          blamed the butchers; and the butchers laid the blame on the axe and
          knife, which were accordingly found guilty, condemned, and cast
          into the sea.<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> together with the formal trial and punishment
          of the axe or knife or both, prove that the ox was here regarded
          not merely as a victim offered to a god, but as itself a sacred
          creature, the slaughter of which was sacrilege or murder. This is
          borne out by a statement of Varro that to kill an ox was formerly a
          capital crime in Attica.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153"
          href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> The
          mode of selecting the victim suggests that the ox which tasted the
          corn was viewed as the corn-deity taking possession of his own.
          This interpretation is supported by the following custom. In
          Beauce, in the district of Orleans, on the 24th or 25th of April
          they make a straw-man called <span class="tei tei-q">“the great
          <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mondard</span></span>.”</span> For they say
          that the old <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">mondard</span></span> is now
          dead and it is necessary to make a new one. The straw-man is
          carried in solemn procession up and down the village and at last is
          placed upon the oldest apple-tree. There he remains till the apples
          are gathered, when he is taken down and thrown into the water, or
          he is burned and his ashes cast into water. But the person who
          plucks the first fruit from the tree succeeds to the title of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the great <span lang="fr" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mondard</span></span>.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>. Here
          the straw figure, called <span class="tei tei-q">“the great
          <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mondard</span></span>”</span> and placed on
          the apple-tree in spring, represents the spirit of the tree, who,
          dead in winter, revives when the apple-blossoms appear in spring.
          The fact, therefore, that the person who plucks the first fruit
          from the apple-tree receives the name of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the great <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mondard</span></span>”</span> proves that he
          is regarded as a representative of the tree-spirit. Primitive
          peoples are, as a rule, reluctant to taste the annual first-fruits
          of any crop, until some ceremony has been performed which makes it
          safe and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg
          041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          pious for them to do so. The reason of this reluctance appears to
          be that the first-fruits either are the property of, or actually
          contain, a divinity. Therefore when a man or animal is seen boldly
          to appropriate the sacred first-fruits, he or it is naturally
          regarded as the divinity himself in human or animal form taking
          possession of his own. The time of the Athenian sacrifice—about the
          close of the threshing—suggests that the wheat and barley laid upon
          the altar were a harvest offering; and the sacramental character of
          the subsequent repast—all partaking of the flesh of the divine
          animal—would make it parallel to the harvest suppers of modern
          Europe, in which, as we have seen, the flesh of the animal who
          represents the corn-spirit is eaten by the harvesters. Again, the
          tradition that the sacrifice was instituted in order to put an end
          to drought and famine is in favour of taking it as a harvest
          festival. The resurrection of the corn-spirit, represented by
          setting up the stuffed ox and yoking it to the plough, may be
          compared with the resurrection of the tree-spirit in the person of
          his representative, the Wild Man.<a id="noteref_155" name=
          "noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ox appears
          as a representative of the corn-spirit in other parts of the world.
          At Great Bassam, in Guinea, two oxen are slain annually to procure
          a good harvest. If the sacrifice is to be effectual, it is
          necessary that the oxen should weep. So all the women of the
          village sit in front of the beasts, chanting, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The ox will weep; yes, he will weep!”</span> From time
          to time one of the women walks round the beasts, throwing manioc
          meal or palm wine upon them, especially into their eyes. When tears
          roll down from the eyes of the oxen, the people dance, singing,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The ox <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> weeps! the ox weeps!”</span> Then two men
          seize the tails of the beasts and cut them off at one blow. It is
          believed that a great misfortune will happen in the course of the
          year if the tails are not severed at one blow. The oxen are
          afterwards killed, and their flesh is eaten by the chiefs.<a id=
          "noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a> Here
          the tears of the oxen, like those of the human victims amongst the
          Khonds, are probably a rain-charm. We have already seen that the
          virtue of the corn-spirit, embodied in animal form, is sometimes
          supposed to reside in the tail, and that the last handful of corn
          is sometimes conceived as the tail of the corn-spirit.<a id=
          "noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a> Still
          more clearly does the ox appear as a personification of the
          corn-spirit in a ceremony which is observed in all the provinces
          and districts of China to welcome the approach of spring. On the
          first day of spring the governor or prefect of the city goes in
          procession to the east gate of the city, and sacrifices to the
          Divine Husbandman, who is represented with a bull's head on the
          body of a man. A large effigy of an ox, cow, or buffalo has been
          prepared for the occasion, and stands outside of the east gate,
          with agricultural implements beside it. It is made of
          differently-coloured pieces of paper pasted on a framework either
          by a blind man or according to the directions of a necromancer. The
          colours of the paper indicate the character of the coming year; if
          red prevails, there will be many fires; if white, there will be
          floods and rain, etc. The mandarins walk slowly round the ox,
          beating it severely at each step with rods of various colours. It
          is filled with five kinds of grain, which pour forth when the ox is
          broken by the blows of the rods. The paper fragments are then set
          on fire, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg
          043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and a scramble takes place for the burning fragments, as the people
          believe that whoever gets one of them is sure to be fortunate
          throughout the year. A live buffalo is then killed, and its flesh
          is divided among the mandarins. According to one account, the
          effigy of the ox is made of clay, and, after being beaten by the
          governor, is stoned by the people till they break it in pieces,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“from which they expect an abundant
          year.”</span><a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href=

          the corn-spirit appears to be plainly represented by the
          corn-filled ox, whose fragments may therefore be supposed to bring
          fertility with them. We may compare the Silesian spring custom of
          burning the effigy of Death, scrambling for the burning fragments,
          and burying them in the fields to secure a good crop, and the
          Florentine custom of sawing the Old Woman and scrambling for the
          dried fruits with which she was filled.<a id="noteref_159" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole,
          then, we may perhaps conclude that both as a goat and as a bull
          Dionysus was essentially a god of vegetation. The Chinese and
          European customs just referred to may perhaps shed light on the
          custom of rending a live bull or goat at the rites of Dionysus. The
          animal was torn in fragments, as the Khond victim was cut in
          pieces, in order that the worshippers might each secure a portion
          of the life-giving and fertilising influence of the god. The flesh
          was eaten raw as a sacrament, and we may conjecture that some of it
          was taken home to be buried in the fields, or otherwise employed so
          as to convey to the fruits of the earth the quickening influence of
          the god of vegetation. The resurrection of Dionysus, related

          have been represented in his rites by stuffing and setting up the
          slain ox, as was done at the Athenian <span lang="el" class=

          the corn-goddess Demeter, and remembering that in European

          may now ask, may not the pig, which was so closely associated with
          Demeter, be nothing but the goddess herself in animal form? The pig

          the pig was regularly sacrificed in her mysteries, the reason
          assigned being that the pig injures the corn and is therefore an
          enemy of the goddess.<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href=

          after an animal has been conceived as a god or a god as an animal,
          it sometimes happens, as we have seen, that the god sloughs off his
          animal form and becomes purely anthropomorphic; and that then the
          animal, which at first had been slain in the character of the god,
          comes to be regarded as a victim offered to the god on the ground
          of its hostility to the deity; in short, that the god is sacrificed
          to himself on the ground that he is his own enemy. This happened to
          Dionysus, and it may have happened to Demeter also. And in fact the
          rites of one of her festivals, the Thesmophoria, bear out the view
          that originally the pig was an embodiment of the corn-goddess
          herself, either Demeter or her daughter and double Proserpine. The
          Thesmophoria was an autumn festival, celebrated by women alone in
          October,<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> we
          learn some details about the mode of celebrating the Thesmophoria,
          which shed important light on the part of the festival called the
          Descent or the Ascent. The scholiast tells us that it was customary
          at the Thesmophoria to throw pigs, cakes of dough, and branches of
          pine-trees into <span class="tei tei-q">“the chasms of Demeter and
          Proserpine,”</span> which appear to have been sacred caverns or
          vaults.<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href=
          "#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> In
          these caverns or vaults there were said to be serpents, which
          guarded the caverns and consumed most of the flesh of the pigs and
          dough-cakes which were thrown in. Afterwards—apparently at the next
          annual festival<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href=
          "#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a>—the
          decayed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg
          046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          remains of the pigs, the cakes, and the pine-branches were fetched
          by women called <span class="tei tei-q">“drawers,”</span> who,
          after observing rules of ceremonial purity for three days,
          descended into the caverns, and, frightening away the serpents by
          clapping their hands, brought up the remains and placed them on the
          altar. Whoever got a piece of the decayed flesh and cakes, and
          sowed it with the seed-corn in his field, was believed to be sure
          of a good crop.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To explain this
          rude and ancient rite the following legend was told. At the moment
          that Pluto carried off Proserpine, a swineherd called Eubuleus was
          herding his swine on the spot, and his herd was engulfed in the
          chasm down which Pluto vanished with Proserpine. Accordingly at the
          Thesmophoria pigs were annually thrown into caverns in order to
          commemorate the disappearance of the swine of Eubuleus. It follows
          from this that the casting of the pigs into the vaults at the
          Thesmophoria formed part of the dramatic representation of
          Proserpine's descent into the lower world; and as no image of
          Proserpine appears to have been thrown in, it follows that the
          descent of the pigs must have been, not an accompaniment of her
          descent, but the descent itself; in short, the pigs were
          Proserpine. Afterwards when Proserpine or Demeter (for the two are
          equivalent) became anthropomorphic, a reason had to be found for
          the custom of throwing pigs into caverns at her festival; and this
          was done by saying that when Proserpine was carried off, there
          happened to be some swine browsing near, which were swallowed up
          along with her. The story is obviously a forced and awkward attempt
          to bridge over the gulf between the old conception of the
          corn-spirit as a pig and the new conception of her as <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> an anthropomorphic goddess. A trace of
          the older conception survived in the legend that when Demeter was
          looking for the lost Proserpine, the footprints of the latter were
          obliterated by the footprints of a pig;<a id="noteref_170" name=
          "noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a>
          originally, no doubt, the footprints of the pig were the footprints
          of Proserpine and of Demeter herself. A consciousness of the
          intimate connection of the pig with the corn lurks in the tradition
          that the swineherd Eubuleus was a brother of Triptolemus, to whom
          Demeter first imparted the secret of the corn. Indeed, according to
          one version of the story, Eubuleus himself received, jointly with
          his brother Triptolemus, the gift of the corn from Demeter as a
          reward for revealing to her the fate of Proserpine.<a id=
          "noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a>
          Further, it is to be noted that at the Thesmophoria the women
          appear to have eaten swine's flesh.<a id="noteref_172" name=
          "noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> The
          meal, if I am right, must have been a solemn sacrament or
          communion, the worshippers partaking of the body of the god.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As thus
          explained, the Thesmophoria has its analogies in the folk-customs
          of Northern Europe which have been already described. As at the
          Thesmophoria—an autumn festival in honour of the
          corn-goddess—swine's flesh was partly eaten, partly kept in caverns
          till the following year, when it was taken up to be sown with the
          seed-corn in the fields for the purpose of securing a good crop; so
          in the neighbourhood of Grenoble the goat killed on the
          harvest-field is partly eaten at the harvest supper, partly pickled
          and kept till the next harvest;<a id="noteref_173" name=
          "noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> so at
          Pouilly the ox killed on the harvest-field is partly eaten by the
          harvesters, partly pickled and kept till the first day of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name=
          "Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sowing in

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>—probably
          to be then mixed with the seed, or eaten by the ploughmen, or both;
          so at Udvarhely the feathers of the cock which is killed in the
          last sheaf at harvest are kept till spring, and then sown with the
          seed on the field;<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href=
          "#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> so in
          Hessen and Meiningen the flesh of pigs is eaten on Ash Wednesday or
          Candlemas, and the bones are kept till sowing-time, when they are
          put into the field sown or mixed with the seed in the bag;<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> so,
          lastly, the corn from the last sheaf is kept till Christmas, made
          into the Yule Boar, and afterwards broken and mixed with the
          seed-corn at sowing in spring.<a id="noteref_177" name=
          "noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> Thus,
          to put it generally, the corn-spirit is killed in animal form in
          autumn; part of his flesh is eaten as a sacrament by his
          worshippers; and part of it is kept till next sowing-time or
          harvest as a pledge and security for the continuance or renewal of
          the corn-spirit's energies. Whether in the interval between autumn
          and spring he is conceived as dead, or whether, like the ox in the
          <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bouphonia</span></span>, he is supposed to
          come to life again immediately after being killed, is not clear. At
          the Thesmophoria, according to Clement and Pausanias, as emended by
          Lobeck,<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href=
          "#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> the
          pigs were thrown in alive, and were supposed to reappear at the
          festival of the following year. Here, therefore, if we accept
          Lobeck's emendations, the corn-spirit is conceived as alive
          throughout the year; he lives and works under ground, but is
          brought up each autumn to be renewed and then replaced in his
          subterranean abode.<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href=
          "#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If it is
          objected that the Greeks never could have conceived Demeter and
          Proserpine to be embodied in the form of pigs, it may be answered
          that in the cave of Phigalia in Arcadia the Black Demeter was
          represented with the head and mane of a horse on the body of a
          woman.<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href=
          "#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a>
          Between the representation of a goddess as a pig, and the
          representation of her as a woman with a horse's head, there is
          little to choose in respect of barbarism. The legend told of the
          Phigalian Demeter indicates that the horse was one of the animal
          forms assumed in ancient Greece, as in modern Europe,<a id=
          "noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a> by
          the corn-spirit. It was said that in her search for her daughter,
          Demeter assumed the form of a mare to escape the addresses of
          Poseidon, and that, offended at his importunity, she withdrew to
          the cave of Phigalia. There, robed in black, she stayed so long
          that the fruits of the earth were perishing, and mankind would have
          died of famine if Pan had not soothed the angry goddess and
          persuaded her to quit the cave. In memory of this event, the
          Phigalians set up an image of the Black Demeter in the cave; it
          represented a woman dressed in a long robe, with the head and mane
          of a horse.<a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href=
          "#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a> The
          Black Demeter, in whose absence the fruits of the earth perish, is
          plainly a mythical expression for the state of vegetation in
          winter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Passing now to
          Attis and Adonis, we may note a few facts which seem to show that
          these deities of vegetation had also, like other deities of
          vegetation, their animal embodiments. The worshippers of Attis
          abstained from eating the flesh of swine.<a id="noteref_183" name=

          050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          certainly in favour of supposing that the pig was regarded as an
          embodiment of Attis. And the legend that Attis was killed by a
          boar<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href=
          "#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a>
          points in the same direction. For after the examples of the goat
          Dionysus and the pig Demeter it may almost be laid down as a rule
          that an animal which is said to have injured a god was originally
          the god himself. Perhaps the cry of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hyes
          Attes! Hyes Attes!”</span><a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185"
          href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a> which
          was raised by the worshippers of Attis, may be neither more nor
          less than <span class="tei tei-q">“Pig Attis! Pig
          Attis!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to
          Adonis, his connection with the boar was not always explained by
          the story that he was killed by a boar. According to another story,
          a boar rent with his tusk the bark of the tree in which the infant
          Adonis was born.<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href=
          "#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a>
          According to another story, he was killed by Hephaestus on Mount
          Lebanon while he was hunting wild boars.<a id="noteref_187" name=
          "noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a> These
          variations in the legend serve to show that, while the connection
          of the boar with Adonis was certain, the reason of the connection
          was not understood, and that consequently different stories were
          devised to explain it. Certainly the pig was one of the sacred
          animals of the Syrians. At the great religious metropolis of
          Hierapolis pigs were neither sacrificed nor eaten, and if a man
          touched a pig he was unclean for the rest of the day. Some people
          said this was because the pigs were unclean; others said it was
          because the pigs were sacred.<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188"
          href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a> This
          difference of opinion points to a state of religious thought and
          feeling in which the ideas of sanctity and uncleanness are not yet
          differentiated, and which is best <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> indicated by the word taboo. It is quite
          consistent with this that the pig should have been held to be an
          embodiment of the divine Adonis, and the analogies of Dionysus and
          Demeter make it probable that the story of the hostility of the
          animal to the god was only a modern misunderstanding of the old
          view of the god as embodied in a pig. The rule that pigs were not
          sacrificed or eaten by worshippers of Attis and presumably of
          Adonis, does not exclude the possibility that in these cults the
          pig was slain on solemn occasions as a representative of the god
          and consumed sacramentally by the worshippers. Indeed, the
          sacramental killing and eating of an animal, that is the killing
          and eating it as a god, implies that the animal is sacred, and is,
          as a general rule, not killed.<a id="noteref_189" name=
          "noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The attitude of
          the Jews to the pig was as ambiguous as that of the heathen Syrians
          towards the same animal. The Greeks could not decide whether the
          Jews worshipped swine or abominated them. On the one hand they
          might not eat swine; but on the other hand they might not kill
          them.<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href=
          "#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> And
          if the former rule speaks for the uncleanness, the latter speaks
          still more strongly for the sanctity of the animal. For whereas
          both rules may, and one rule must, be explained on the supposition
          that the pig was sacred; neither rule must, and one rule cannot, be
          explained on the supposition that the pig was unclean. If,
          therefore, we prefer the former supposition, we must conclude
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name=
          "Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that, originally at
          least, the pig was held to be sacred rather than unclean by the
          Israelites. This is confirmed by the fact that down to the time of
          Isaiah some of the Jews used to meet secretly in gardens to eat the
          flesh of swine and mice as a religious rite.<a id="noteref_191"
          name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class=

          Doubtless this was a very ancient rite, dating from a time when
          both the pig and the mouse were venerated as divine, and when their
          flesh was partaken of sacramentally on rare and solemn occasions as
          the body and blood of gods. And in general it may be said that all
          so-called unclean animals were originally sacred; the reason why
          they were not eaten was that they were divine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In ancient
          Egypt, within historical times, the pig occupied the same dubious
          position as in Syria and Palestine, though at first sight its
          uncleanness is more prominent than its sanctity. The Egyptians are
          generally said by Greek writers to have abhorred the pig as a foul
          and loathsome animal.<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href=

          Swineherds, though natives of Egypt, were forbidden to enter any
          temple, and they were the only men who were thus excluded. No one
          would give his daughter in marriage to a swineherd, or marry a
          swineherd's daughter; the swineherds married among
          themselves.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href=

          once a year the Egyptians sacrificed pigs to the moon and to
          Osiris, and not only sacrificed them, but ate of their flesh,
          though on any other day of the year <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class=

          of their flesh. Those who were too poor to offer a pig on this day
          baked cakes of dough, and offered them instead.<a id="noteref_196"

          can hardly be explained except by the supposition that the pig was
          a sacred animal which was eaten sacramentally by his worshippers
          once a year. The view that in Egypt the pig was a sacred animal is
          borne out by the very facts which, to moderns, might seem to prove
          the contrary. Thus the Egyptians thought, as we have seen, that to
          drink pig's milk produced leprosy. But exactly analogous views are
          held by savages about the animals and plants which they deem most
          sacred. Thus in the island of Wetar (between New Guinea and
          Celebes) people believe themselves to be variously descended from
          wild pigs, serpents, crocodiles, turtles, dogs, and eels; a man may
          not eat an animal of the kind from which he is descended; if he
          does so, he will become a leper, and go mad.<a id="noteref_197"

          Amongst the Omaha Indians of North America men whose totem (sacred

          In Samoa each man had generally his god in the shape of some
          species of animal; and if he ate one of these divine animals, it
          was supposed that the god avenged himself by taking up his abode in
          the eater's body, and there generating an animal of the kind he had
          eaten till it caused his death. For example, if a man whose god was
          the prickly sea-urchin, ate one of these creatures, a prickly
          sea-urchin grew in his stomach and killed him. If his god was an
          eel, and he ate an eel, he became very ill, and before he died the
          voice of the god was heard from his stomach saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am killing this man; he ate my
          incarnation.”</span><a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a> These
          examples prove that the eating of a sacred animal is often believed
          to produce skin-disease or even death; so far, therefore, they
          support the view that the pig must have been sacred in Egypt, since
          the effect of drinking its milk was believed to be leprosy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the rule
          that, after touching a pig, a man had to wash himself and his
          clothes, also favours the view of the sanctity of the pig. For it
          is a common belief that the effect of contact with a sacred object
          must be removed, by washing or otherwise, before a man is free to
          mingle with his fellows. Thus the Jews wash their hands after
          reading the sacred scriptures. Before coming forth from the
          tabernacle after the sin-offering, the high priest had to wash
          himself, and put off the garments which he had worn in the holy
          place.<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href=

          was a rule of Greek ritual that, in offering an expiatory
          sacrifice, the sacrificer should not touch the sacrifice, and that,
          after the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg

          Polynesians felt strongly the need of ridding themselves of the
          sacred contagion, if it may be so called, which they caught by
          touching sacred objects. Various ceremonies were performed for the
          purpose of removing this sacred contagion. For example, in Tonga a
          man who happened to touch a sacred chief, or anything personally
          belonging to him, as his clothes or his mat, was obliged to go
          through the ceremony of touching the soles of the chief's (or of
          any chief's) feet with his hands, first applying the palm and then
          the back of each hand; next he had to rinse his hands in water, or,
          if there was no water near, the sap of the plantain or banana-tree
          might be used as a substitute. If he were to feed himself with his
          hands before he performed this ceremony, it was believed that he
          would swell up and die, or at least be afflicted with scrofula or
          some other disease.<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href=

          have already seen what fatal effects are supposed to follow, and do
          actually follow, from contact with a sacred object in New

          short, primitive man believes that what is sacred is dangerous; it
          is pervaded by a sort of electrical sanctity which communicates a
          shock to, even if it does not kill, whatever comes in contact with
          it. Hence the savage is unwilling to touch or even to see that
          which he deems peculiarly holy. Thus Bechuanas, of the Crocodile
          clan, think it <span class="tei tei-q">“hateful and unlucky”</span>
          to meet or see a crocodile; the sight is thought to cause
          inflammation of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg
          056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          eyes. Yet the crocodile is their most sacred object; they call it

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the light of
          these parallels the beliefs and customs of the Egyptians touching
          the pig are probably to be explained as based upon an opinion of
          the extreme sanctity rather than of the extreme uncleanness of the
          animal; or rather, to put it more correctly, they imply that the
          animal was looked on, not simply as a filthy and disgusting
          creature, but as a being endowed with high supernatural powers, and
          that as such it was regarded with that primitive <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sentiment of religious awe and fear in
          which the feelings of reverence and abhorrence are almost equally
          blended. The ancients themselves seem to have been aware that there
          was another side to the horror with which swine seemed to inspire
          the Egyptians. For the Greek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus,
          who resided fourteen months in Egypt and conversed with the
          priests,<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href=
          "#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> was
          of opinion that the Egyptians spared the pig, not out of
          abhorrence, but from a regard to its utility in agriculture; for,
          according to him, when the Nile had subsided, herds of swine were
          turned loose over the fields to tread the seed down into the moist
          earth.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href=
          "#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> But
          when a being is thus the object of mixed and implicitly
          contradictory feelings, he may be said to occupy a position of
          unstable equilibrium. In course of time one of the contradictory
          feelings is likely to prevail over the other, and according as the
          feeling which finally predominates is that of reverence or
          abhorrence, the being who is the object of it will rise into a god
          or sink into a devil. The latter, on the whole, was the fate of the
          pig in Egypt. For in historical times the fear and horror of the
          pig seem certainly to have outweighed the reverence and worship of
          which he must once have been the object, and of which, even in his
          fallen state, he never quite lost trace. He came to be looked on as
          an embodiment of Set or Typhon, the Egyptian devil and enemy of
          Osiris. For it was in the shape of a boar that Typhon menaced the
          eye of the god Horus, who burned him and instituted the sacrifice
          of the pig, the sun-god Ra having declared the pig
          abominable.<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href=

          that Typhon was hunting a boar when he discovered and mangled the
          body of Osiris, and that this was the reason why the pig was
          sacrificed once a year,<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href=
          "#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> is a
          transparent modernisation of an older story that Osiris, like
          Adonis and Attis, was slain or mangled by a boar, or by Typhon in
          the form of a boar. Thus, the annual sacrifice of a pig to Osiris
          might naturally be interpreted as vengeance inflicted on the
          hostile animal that had slain or mangled the god. But, in the first
          place, when an animal is thus killed as a solemn sacrifice once and
          once only in the year, it generally or always means that the animal
          is divine—that he is spared and respected the rest of the year as a
          god and slain, when he is slain, also in the character of a
          god.<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href=
          "#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> In
          the second place, the examples of Dionysus and Demeter, if not of
          Attis and Adonis, have taught us that the animal which is
          sacrificed to a god on the ground that he is the god's enemy may
          have been, and probably was, originally the god himself. Therefore,
          the fact that the pig was sacrificed once a year to Osiris, and the
          fact that he appears to have been sacrificed on the ground that he
          was the god's enemy, go to show, first, that originally the pig was
          a god, and, second, that he was Osiris. At a later age the pig was
          distinguished from Osiris when the latter became anthropomorphic
          and his original relation to the pig was forgotten; later still,
          the pig was opposed as an enemy to Osiris by mythologists who could
          think of no reason for killing an animal in connection with the
          worship of a god except that the animal was the god's <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> enemy; or, as Plutarch puts it, not
          that which is dear to the gods, but that which is the contrary, is
          fit to be sacrificed.<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href=
          "#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a> At
          this later stage the havoc which a wild boar notoriously makes
          amongst the corn would supply a plausible reason for regarding him
          as an enemy of the corn-spirit, though originally, if I am right,
          the very fact that the boar was found ranging at will through the
          corn was the reason for identifying him with the corn-spirit, to
          whom he was afterwards opposed as an enemy. The view which
          identifies the pig with Osiris derives not a little support from
          the fact that the day on which the pigs were sacrificed to him was
          the day on which, according to tradition, Osiris was killed;<a id=
          "noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a> for
          thus the killing of the pig was the annual representation of the
          killing of Osiris, just as the throwing of the pigs into the
          caverns at the Thesmophoria was an annual representation of the
          descent of Proserpine into the lower world; and both customs are
          parallel to the European practice of killing a goat, cock, etc., at
          harvest as a representative of the corn-spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the view
          that the pig, originally Osiris himself, afterwards came to be
          regarded as an embodiment of his enemy Typhon, is supported by the
          similar relation of red-haired men and red oxen to Typhon. For in
          regard to the red-haired men who were burned and whose ashes were
          scattered with winnowing-fans, we have seen fair grounds for
          believing that originally, like the red-haired puppies killed at
          Rome in spring, they were representatives of the corn-spirit
          himself, that is, of Osiris, and were slain for the express purpose
          of making the corn turn red or golden.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet at a later
          time these men were explained to be representatives, not of Osiris,
          but of his enemy Typhon,<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219"
          href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> and
          the killing of them was regarded as an act of vengeance inflicted
          on the enemy of the god. Similarly, the red oxen sacrificed by the
          Egyptians were said to be sacrificed on the ground of their
          resemblance to Typhon;<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href=
          "#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a>
          though it is more likely that originally they were slain on the
          ground of their resemblance to the corn-spirit Osiris. We have seen
          that the ox is a common representative of the corn-spirit and is
          slain as such on the harvest-field.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Osiris was
          regularly identified with the bull Apis of Memphis and the bull
          Mnevis of Heliopolis.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href=
          "#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a> But
          it is hard to say whether these bulls were embodiments of him as
          the corn-spirit, as the red oxen appear to have been, or whether
          they were not rather entirely distinct deities which got fused with
          Osiris by syncretism. The fact that these two bulls were worshipped
          by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">all</span></em> the Egyptians,<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> seems
          to put them on a different footing from the ordinary sacred animals
          whose cults were purely local. Hence, if the latter were evolved
          from totems, as they probably were, some other origin would have to
          be found for the worship of Apis and Mnevis. If these bulls were
          not originally embodiments of the corn-god Osiris, they may
          possibly be descendants of the sacred cattle <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> worshipped by a pastoral people.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a> If
          this were so, ancient Egypt would exhibit a stratification of the
          three great types of religion corresponding to the three great
          stages of society. Totemism or (roughly speaking) the worship of
          wild animals—the religion of society in the hunting stage—would be
          represented by the worship of the local sacred animals; the worship
          of cattle—the religion of society in the pastoral stage—would be
          represented by the cults of Apis and Mnevis; and the worship of
          cultivated plants, especially of corn—the religion of society in
          the agricultural stage—would be represented by the worship of
          Osiris and Isis. The Egyptian reverence for cows, which were never
          killed,<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href=
          "#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> might
          belong either to the second or third of these stages. The fact that
          cows were regarded as sacred to, that is, as embodiments of Isis,
          who was represented with cow's horns, would indicate that they,
          like the red oxen, were embodiments of the corn-spirit. However,
          this identification of Isis with the cow, like that of Osiris with
          the bulls Apis and Mnevis, may be only an effect of syncretism. But
          whatever the original relation of Apis to Osiris may have been,
          there is one fact about the former which ought not to be passed
          over in a chapter dealing with the custom of killing the god.
          Although the bull Apis was worshipped as a god with much pomp and
          profound reverence, he was not suffered to live beyond a certain
          length of time which was prescribed by the sacred books, and on the
          expiry of which he was drowned in a holy spring.<a id="noteref_225"
          name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class=

          it cannot always have been enforced, for the tombs of the Apis
          bulls have been discovered in the present century, and from the
          inscriptions on them it appears that in the twenty-second dynasty
          two bulls lived more than twenty-six years.<a id="noteref_227"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are now in a
          position to hazard a conjecture—for it can be little more—as to the
          meaning of the tradition that Virbius, the first of the divine
          Kings of the Wood at Aricia, was killed by horses. Having found,
          first, that spirits of vegetation are not infrequently represented
          in the form of horses;<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href=
          "#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> and,
          second, that the animal which in later legends is said to have
          injured the god was sometimes originally the god himself, we may
          conjecture that the horses by which Virbius was said to have been
          slain were really embodiments of him as a deity of vegetation. The
          myth that Virbius had been killed by horses was probably invented
          to explain certain features in his cult, amongst others the custom
          of excluding horses from his sacred grove. For myth changes while
          custom remains constant; men continue to do what their fathers did
          before them, though the reasons on which their fathers acted have
          been long forgotten. The history of religion is a long attempt to
          reconcile old custom with new reason; to find a sound theory for an
          absurd practice. In the case before us we may be sure that the myth
          is more modern than the custom and by no means represents the
          original reason for excluding horses from the grove. From the fact
          that horses were so excluded it might be inferred that they could
          not be the sacred animals or embodiments of the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> god of the grove. But the inference
          would be rash. The goat was at one time a sacred animal or
          embodiment of Athene, as may be inferred from the practice of
          representing her clad in a goat-skin (<span lang="el" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aegis</span></span>). Yet the goat was neither
          sacrificed to her as a rule, nor allowed to enter her great
          sanctuary, the Acropolis at Athens. The reason alleged for this was
          that the goat injured the olive, the sacred tree of Athene.<a id=
          "noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> So
          far, therefore, the relation of the goat to Athene is parallel to
          the relation of the horse to Virbius, both animals being excluded
          from the sanctuary on the ground of injury done by them to the god.
          But from Varro we learn that there was an exception to the rule
          which excluded the goat from the Acropolis. Once a year, he says,
          the goat was driven on to the Acropolis for a necessary
          sacrifice.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href=
          "#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a> Now,
          as has been remarked before, when an animal is sacrificed once and
          once only in the year, it is probably slain, not as a victim
          offered to the god, but as a representative of the god himself.
          Therefore we may infer that if a goat was sacrificed on the
          Acropolis once a year, it was sacrificed in the character of Athene
          herself; and it may be conjectured that the skin of the sacrificed
          animal was placed on the statue of the goddess and formed the
          <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aegis</span></span>, which would thus be
          renewed annually. Similarly at Thebes in Egypt rams were sacred and
          were not sacrificed. But on one day in the year a ram was killed,
          and its skin was placed on the statue of the god Ammon.<a id=
          "noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> Now,
          if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove better, we might find
          the rule of excluding horses from it, like the rule of excluding
          goats from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg
          064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Acropolis at Athens, was subject to an annual exception, a
          horse being once a year taken into the grove and sacrificed as an
          embodiment of the god Virbius. By the usual misunderstanding the
          horse thus killed would come in time to be regarded as an enemy
          offered up in sacrifice to the god whom he had injured, like the
          pig which was sacrificed to Demeter and Osiris or the goat which
          was sacrificed to Athene and Dionysus. It is so easy for a writer
          to record a rule without noticing an exception that we need not
          wonder at finding the rule of the Arician grove recorded without
          any mention of an exception such as I suppose. If we had had only
          the statements of Athenaeus and Pliny, we should have known only
          the rule which forbade the sacrifice of goats to Athene and
          excluded them from the Acropolis, without being aware of the
          important exception which the fortunate preservation of Varro's
          work has revealed to us.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conjecture
          that once a year a horse may have been sacrificed in the Arician
          grove as a representative of the deity of the grove derives some
          support from the fact that a horse sacrifice of a similar character
          took place once a year at Rome. On the 15th of October in each year
          a chariot-race took place on the Field of Mars. The right-hand
          horse of the victorious team was sacrificed to Mars by being
          stabbed with a spear. The object of the sacrifice was to ensure
          good crops. The animal's head was cut off and adorned with a string
          of loaves. The inhabitants of two wards—the Sacred Way and the
          Subura—then contended with each other who should get the head. If
          the people of the Sacred Way got it, they fastened it to a wall of
          the king's house; if the people of the Subura got it, they fastened
          it to the Mamilian tower. The horse's <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> tail was cut off and carried to the king's
          house with such speed that the blood dripped on the hearth of the
          house.<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href=
          "#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>
          Further, it appears that the blood of the horse was caught and
          preserved till the 21st of April, when it was mixed by the Vestal
          virgins with the blood of the unborn calves which had been
          sacrificed six days before. The mixture was then distributed to
          shepherds, and used by them for fumigating their flocks.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this ceremony
          the decoration of the horse's head with a string of loaves, and the
          alleged object of the sacrifice, namely, to procure a good harvest,
          clearly indicate that the horse was killed as one of those animal
          representatives of the corn-spirit of which we have seen so many
          examples. The custom of cutting off the horse's tail is like the
          African custom of cutting off the tails of the oxen and sacrificing
          them to obtain a good crop.<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234"
          href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a> In
          both the Roman and the African custom the animal represents the
          corn-spirit; and its fructifying power is supposed to reside
          especially in its tail. The latter idea occurs, as we have seen, in
          European folk-lore.<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href=

          Again, the custom of fumigating the cattle in spring with the blood
          of the horse may be compared with the custom of giving the Maiden
          as fodder to the cattle at Christmas, and giving the Yule Boar to
          the ploughing oxen or horses to eat in spring.<a id="noteref_236"

          these customs aim at ensuring the blessing of the corn-spirit on

          when the Subura, afterwards a low and crowded quarter of the great
          metropolis, was still a separate village, whose inhabitants engaged
          in a friendly contest on the harvest-field with their neighbours of
          Rome, then a little rural town. The Field of Mars on which the
          ceremony took place lay beside the Tiber, and formed part of the

          ran that at the time when the last of the kings was driven from
          Rome, the corn stood ripe for the sickle on the crown lands beside
          the river; but no one would eat the accursed grain and it was flung
          into the river in such heaps that, the water being low with the
          summer heat, it formed the nucleus of an island.<a id="noteref_237"

          horse sacrifice was thus an old autumn custom observed upon the
          king's corn-fields at the end of the harvest. The tail and blood of
          the horse, as the chief parts of the corn-spirit's representative,
          were taken to the king's house and kept there; just as in Germany
          the harvest-cock is nailed on the gable or over the door of the
          farmhouse; and as the last sheaf, in the form of the Maiden, is
          carried home and kept over the fireplace in the Highlands of
          Scotland. Thus the blessing of the corn-spirit was brought to the
          king's house and hearth and, through them, to the community of
          which he was the head. Similarly in the spring and autumn customs
          of Northern Europe the May-pole is sometimes set up in front of the
          house of the mayor or burgomaster, and the last sheaf at harvest is
          brought to him as the head of the village. But while the tail and
          blood fell to the king, the neighbouring village of the Subura,
          which no doubt once had a similar ceremony of its own, was
          gratified <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg
          067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          by being allowed to compete for the prize of the horse's head. The
          Mamilian tower to which the Suburans nailed the horse's head when
          they succeeded in carrying it off, appears to have been a
          peel-tower or keep of the old Mamilian family, the magnates of the
          village.<a id="noteref_238" name="noteref_238" href=
          "#note_238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a> The
          ceremony thus performed on the king's fields and at his house on
          behalf of the whole town and of the neighbouring village
          presupposes a time when each commune performed a similar ceremony
          on its own fields. In the rural districts of Latium the villages
          may have continued to observe the custom, each on its own land,
          long after the Roman hamlets had merged their separate
          harvest-homes in the common celebration on the king's lands.<a id=
          "noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a> There
          is no intrinsic improbability in the supposition that the sacred
          grove of Aricia, like the Field of Mars at Rome, may have been the
          scene of a common harvest celebration, at which a horse was
          sacrificed with the same rude rites on behalf of the neighbouring
          villages. The horse would represent the fructifying spirit both of
          the tree and of the corn, for the two ideas melt into each other,
          as we see in customs like the Harvest-May.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now seen
          that the corn-spirit is represented sometimes in human, sometimes
          in animal form, and that in both cases he is killed in the person
          of his representative and eaten sacramentally. To find examples of
          actually killing the human representative of the corn-spirit we had
          of course to go to savage <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg

          races; but the harvest suppers of our European peasants have
          furnished unmistakable examples of the sacramental eating of
          animals as representatives of the corn-spirit. But further, as
          might have been anticipated, the new corn is itself eaten
          sacramentally, that is, as the body of the corn-spirit. In
          Wermland, Sweden, the farmer's wife uses the grain of the last
          sheaf to bake a loaf in the shape of a little girl; this loaf is
          divided amongst the whole household and eaten by them.<a id=
          "noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> Here
          the loaf represents the corn-spirit conceived as a maiden; just as
          in Scotland the corn-spirit is similarly conceived and represented
          by the last sheaf made up in the form of a woman and bearing the
          name of the Maiden. As usual, the corn-spirit is believed to reside
          in the last sheaf; and to eat a loaf made from the last sheaf is,
          therefore, to eat the corn-spirit itself. Similarly at La Palisse
          in France a man made of dough is hung upon the fir-tree which is
          carried on the last harvest-waggon. The tree and the dough-man are
          taken to the mayor's house and kept there till the vintage is over.
          Then the close of the harvest is celebrated by a feast at which the
          mayor breaks the dough-man in pieces and gives the pieces to the
          people to eat.<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          examples the corn-spirit is represented and eaten in human shape.
          In other cases, though the new corn is not baked in loaves of human
          shape, still the solemn ceremonies with which it is eaten suffice
          to indicate that it is partaken of sacramentally, that is, as the
          body of the corn-spirit. For example, the following ceremonies used
          to be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name=
          "Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> observed by
          Lithuanian peasants at eating the new corn. When the harvest and
          the sowing of the new corn were over, each farmer held a festival
          called Sabarios, that is, <span class="tei tei-q">“the mixing or
          throwing together.”</span> He took a handful of each kind of
          grain—wheat, barley, oats, flax, beans, lentils, etc.; and each
          handful he divided into three parts. The twenty-seven portions of
          each grain were then thrown on a heap and all mixed up together.
          The grain used had to be the grain which was first threshed and
          winnowed and which had been set aside and kept for this purpose. A
          part of the grain thus mixed was used to bake little loaves, one
          for each of the household; the rest was mixed with more barley or
          oats and made into beer. The first beer brewed from this mixture
          was for the drinking of the farmer, his wife, and children; the
          second brew was for the servants. The beer being ready, the farmer
          chose an evening when no stranger was expected. Then he knelt down
          before the barrel of beer, drew a jugful of the liquor and poured
          it on the bung of the barrel, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“O
          fruitful earth, make rye and barley and all kinds of corn to
          flourish.”</span> Next he took the jug to the parlour, where his
          wife and children awaited him. On the floor of the parlour lay
          bound a black or white or speckled (not a red) cock and a hen of
          the same colour and of the same brood, which must have been hatched
          within the year. Then the farmer knelt down, with the jug in his
          hand, and thanked God for the harvest and prayed for a good crop
          next year. Then all lifted up their hands and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O God, and thou, O earth, we give you this cock and
          hen as a free-will offering.”</span> With that the farmer killed
          the fowls with the blows of a wooden spoon, for he might not cut
          their heads off. After the first prayer <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> and after killing each of the birds he poured
          out a third of the beer. Then his wife boiled the fowls in a new
          pot which had never been used before. A bushel was then set, bottom
          upwards, on the floor, and on it were placed the little loaves
          mentioned above and the boiled fowls. Next the new beer was
          fetched, together with a ladle and three mugs, none of which was
          used except on this occasion. When the farmer had ladled the beer
          into the mugs, the family knelt down round the bushel. The father
          then uttered a prayer and drank off the three mugs of beer. The
          rest followed his example. Then the loaves and the flesh of the
          fowls were eaten, after which the beer went round again, till every
          one had emptied each of the three mugs nine times. None of the food
          should remain over; but if anything did happen to be left, it was
          consumed next morning with the same ceremonies. The bones were then
          given to the dog to eat; if he did not eat them all up, the remains
          were buried under the dung in the cattle-stall. This ceremony was
          observed at the beginning of December. On the day on which it
          occurred no bad word might be spoken.<a id="noteref_242" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was the
          custom about two hundred years ago. At the present day in

          Amongst the Kafirs of Natal and Zululand, no one may eat of the new
          fruits till after a festival which marks the beginning of the Kafir
          year. All the people assemble at the king's kraal, where they feast
          and dance. Before they separate the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“dedication of the people”</span> takes place. Various
          fruits of the earth, as corn, mealies, and pumpkins, mixed with the
          flesh of a sacrificed animal and with <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“medicine,”</span> are boiled in great pots, and a
          little of this food is placed in each man's mouth by the king
          himself. After thus partaking of the sanctified fruits, a man is
          himself sanctified for the whole year, and may immediately get in
          his crops.<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amongst the
          Creek Indians of North America, the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">busk</span></span> or festival of first-fruits
          was the chief ceremony of the year.<a id="noteref_258" name=

          was held in July or August, when the corn was ripe, and marked the
          end of the old year and the beginning of the new one. Before it
          took place none of the Indians would eat or even handle any part of
          the new harvest. Sometimes each town had its own busk; sometimes
          several towns united to hold one in common. Before celebrating the
          busk, the people provided themselves with new clothes and new
          household utensils and furniture; they collected their old clothes
          and rubbish, together with all the remaining grain and other old
          provisions, cast them together in one common heap, and consumed
          them with fire.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> As a
          preparation for the ceremony, all the fires in the village were
          extinguished, and the ashes swept clean away. In particular, the
          hearth or altar of the temple was dug up and the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ashes carried out. Then the chief
          priest put some roots of the button-snake plant, with some green
          tobacco leaves and a little of the new fruits, at the bottom of the
          fireplace, which he afterwards ordered to be covered up with white
          clay, and wetted over with clean water. A thick arbour of green
          branches of young trees was then made over the altar.<a id=
          "noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class=

          Meanwhile the women at home were cleaning out their houses,
          renewing the old hearths, and scouring all the cooking vessels that
          they might be ready to receive the new fire and the new
          fruits.<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href=
          "#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a> The
          public or sacred square was carefully swept of even the smallest
          crumbs of previous feasts, <span class="tei tei-q">“for fear of
          polluting the first-fruit offerings.”</span> Also every vessel that
          had contained or had been used about any food during the expiring
          year was removed from the temple before sunset. Then all the men
          who were not known to have violated the law of the first-fruit
          offering and that of marriage during the year were summoned by a
          crier to enter the holy square and observe a solemn fast. But the
          women (except six old ones), the children, and all who had not
          attained the rank of warriors were forbidden to enter the square.
          Sentinels were also posted at the corners of the square to keep out
          all persons deemed impure and all animals. A strict fast was then
          observed for two nights and a day, the devotees drinking a bitter
          decoction of button-snake root <span class="tei tei-q">“in order to
          vomit and purge their sinful bodies.”</span> That the people
          outside the square might also be purified, one of the old men laid
          down a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg
          077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          quantity of green tobacco at a corner of the square; this was
          carried off by an old woman and distributed to the people without,
          who chewed and swallowed it <span class="tei tei-q">“in order to
          afflict their souls.”</span> During this general fast, the women,
          children, and men of weak constitution were allowed to eat after
          mid-day, but not before. On the morning when the fast ended, the
          women brought a quantity of the old year's food to the outside of
          the sacred square. These provisions were then brought in and set
          before the famished multitude, but all traces of them had to be
          removed before noon. When the sun was declining from the meridian,
          all the people were commanded by the voice of a crier to stay
          within doors, to do no bad act, and to be sure to extinguish and
          throw away every spark of the old fire. Universal silence now
          reigned. Then the high priest made the new fire by the friction of
          two pieces of wood, and placed it on the altar under the green
          arbour. This new fire was believed to atone for all past crimes
          except murder. Then a basket of new fruits was brought; the high
          priest took out a little of each sort of fruit, rubbed it with
          bear's oil, and offered it, together with some flesh, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to the bountiful holy spirit of fire, as a first-fruit
          offering, and an annual oblation for sin.”</span> He also
          consecrated the sacred emetics (the button-snake root and the
          cassina or black-drink) by pouring a little of them into the fire.
          The persons who had remained outside now approached, without
          entering, the sacred square; and the chief priest thereupon made a
          speech, exhorting the people to observe their old rites and
          customs, announcing that the new divine fire had purged away the
          sins of the past year, and earnestly warning the women that, if any
          of them had not extinguished the old fire, or had contracted any
          impurity, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg
          078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          they must forthwith depart, <span class="tei tei-q">“lest the
          divine fire should spoil both them and the people.”</span> Some of
          the new fire was then laid down outside the holy square; the women
          carried it home joyfully, and laid it on their unpolluted hearths.
          When several towns had united to celebrate the festival, the new
          fire might thus be carried for several miles. The new fruits were
          then dressed on the new fires and eaten with bear's oil, which was
          deemed indispensable. At one point of the festival the men rubbed
          the new corn between their hands, then on their faces and
          breasts.<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href=
          "#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a>
          During the festival which followed, the warriors, dressed in their
          wild martial array, their heads covered with white down and
          carrying white feathers in their hands, danced round the sacred
          arbour, under which burned the new fire. The ceremonies lasted
          eight days, during which the strictest continence was practised.
          Towards the conclusion of the festival the warriors fought a mock
          battle; then the men and women together, in three circles, danced
          round the sacred fire. Lastly, all the people smeared themselves
          with white clay and bathed in running water. They came out of the
          water <span class="tei tei-q">“believing themselves out of the
          reach of temporal evil for their past vicious conduct.”</span> So
          they departed in joy and peace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The solemn
          preparations thus made for eating the new corn prove that it was
          eaten as a sacrament. In the Boeroe and Creek customs, this
          sacrament is combined with a sacrifice, and in course of time the
          sacrifice of first-fruits tends to throw the sacrament into the
          shade, if not to supersede it. The mere fact of having offered the
          first-fruits to the gods or ancestral spirits comes now to be
          thought a sufficient preparation <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> for eating the new corn; the gods having
          received their share, man is free to enjoy the rest. This mode of
          viewing the new fruits implies that they are regarded no longer as
          themselves instinct with divine life, but merely as a gift bestowed
          by the gods upon man, who is bound to express his gratitude and
          homage to his divine benefactors by presenting them with a portion
          of the fruits of the earth. But with sacrifice, as distinct from
          sacrament, we are not here concerned.<a id="noteref_263" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
          eating bread sacramentally as the body of a god was practised by
          the Aztecs before the discovery and conquest of Mexico by the
          Spaniards. Twice a year, in May and December, an image of the great
          Mexican god Huitzilopochtli or Vitzilipuztli was made of dough,
          then broken in pieces, and solemnly eaten by his worshippers. The
          May ceremony is thus described by the historian Acosta.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Two daies before this feast, the virgins
          whereof I have spoken (the which were shut up and secluded in the
          same temple and were as it were religious women) did mingle a
          quantitie of the seede of beetes with roasted Mays [maize], and
          then they did mould it with honie, making an idol of that paste in
          bignesse like to that of wood, putting insteede of eyes graines of
          greene glasse, of blue or white; and for teeth graines of Mays set
          forth with all the ornament and furniture that I have said. This
          being finished, all the Noblemen came and brought it an exquisite
          and rich garment, like unto that of the idol, wherewith they did
          attyre it. Being thus clad and deckt, they did set it in an azured
          chaire and in a litter to carry it on their shoulders. The morning
          of this feast being come, an houre before day all the maidens came
          forth attired in white, with new ornaments, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the which that day were called the
          Sisters of their god Vitzilipuztli, they came crowned with garlands
          of Mays rosted and parched, being like unto azahar or the flower of
          orange; and about their neckes they had great chaines of the same,
          which went bauldricke-wise under their left arme. Their cheekes
          were died with vermillion, their armes from the elbow to the wrist
          were covered with red parrots' feathers.”</span> Young men, crowned
          like the virgins with maize, then carried the idol in its litter to
          the foot of the great pyramid-shaped temple, up the steep and
          narrow steps of which it was drawn to the music of flutes,
          trumpets, cornets, and drums. <span class="tei tei-q">“While they
          mounted up the idoll all the people stoode in the Court with much
          reverence and feare. Being mounted to the top, and that they had
          placed it in a little lodge of roses which they held readie,
          presently came the yong men, which strawed many flowers of sundrie
          kindes, wherewith they filled the temple both within and without.
          This done, all the virgins came out of their convent, bringing
          peeces of paste compounded of beetes and rosted Mays, which was of
          the same paste whereof their idol was made and compounded, and they
          were of the fashion of great bones. They delivered them to the yong
          men, who carried them up and laide them at the idoll's feete,
          wherewith they filled the whole place that it could receive no
          more. They called these morcells of paste the flesh and bones of
          Vitzilipuztli.”</span> Then the priests came in their robes of
          office, <span class="tei tei-q">“and putting themselves in order
          about these morsells and peeces of paste, they used certaine
          ceremonies with singing and dauncing. By means whereof they were
          blessed and consecrated for the flesh and bones of this idoll....
          The ceremonies, dauncing, and sacrifice ended, they went

          themselves, and the priests and superiors of the temple tooke the
          idoll of paste, which they spoyled of all the ornaments it had, and
          made many peeces, as well of the idoll itselfe as of the tronchons
          which were consecrated, and then they gave them to the people in
          maner of a communion, beginning with the greater, and continuing
          unto the rest, both men, women, and little children, who received
          it with such teares, feare, and reverence as it was an admirable
          thing, saying that they did eate the flesh and bones of God,
          wherewith they were grieved. Such as had any sicke folkes demaunded
          thereof for them, and carried it with great reverence and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the
          festival in December, which took place at the winter solstice, an
          image of the god Huitzilopochtli was made of seeds of various sorts
          kneaded into a dough with the blood of children. The bones of the
          god were represented by pieces of acacia wood, This image was
          placed on the chief altar of the temple, and on the day of the
          festival the king offered incense to it. Early next day it was
          taken down and set on its feet in a great hall. Then a priest took
          a flint-tipped dart and hurled it into the breast of the
          dough-image, piercing it through and through. This was called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“killing the god Huitzilopochtli so that
          his body might be eaten.”</span> One of the priests cut out the
          heart of the image and gave it to the king to eat. The rest of the
          image was divided into minute pieces, of which every man great and
          small, down to the male children in the cradle, received one to
          eat. But no woman might taste a morsel. The ceremony was called
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          festival the Mexicans made little images in human shape to
          represent the cloud-capped mountains. These images were made of
          paste of various seeds and were dressed in paper ornaments. Some
          people made five, others ten, others as many as fifteen of these
          paste images. They were placed in the oratory of each house and
          worshipped. Four times in the course of the night offerings of food
          were made to them in tiny vessels; and people sang and played the
          flute before them all night. At break of day the priests stabbed
          the images with a weaver's instrument, cut off their heads, and
          tore out their hearts, which they presented to the master of the
          house on a green saucer. The bodies of the images were then eaten

          effigies of men and women were dedicated at the festival of the

          in Rome; one effigy was hung up for every free person in the house,
          and one effigy, of a different kind, for every slave. The reason

          going about, and it was hoped that they would carry off the
          effigies at the door instead of the living people in the house.

          in human form, which appear to have been baked at Aricia, were
          sacramental bread, and that in the old days, when the divine King
          of the Wood was annually slain, loaves were made in his image, like
          the paste figures of the gods in Mexico, and were eaten
          sacramentally by his worshippers.<a id="noteref_271" name=

          sacraments in honour of Huitzilopochtli were also accompanied by
          the sacrifice of human victims. The tradition that the founder of
          the sacred grove at Aricia was a man named Manius, from whom many
          Manii were descended, would thus be an etymological myth invented
          to explain the name <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">maniae</span></span>
          as applied to these sacramental loaves. A dim recollection of the
          original connection of these loaves with human sacrifices may
          perhaps be traced in the story that the effigies dedicated to Mania
          at the Compitalia were substitutes for human victims. The story
          itself, however, is probably devoid of foundation, since the
          practice of putting up dummies to divert the attention of demons
          from living people is not uncommon. For example, when an epidemic
          is raging, some of the Dyaks of Borneo set up wooden images at
          their doors, in the hope that the demons of the plague will be
          deceived into carrying off the images instead of the people.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
          killing the god has now been traced <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> amongst peoples who have reached the
          agricultural stage of society. We have seen that the spirit of the
          corn, or of other cultivated plants, is commonly represented either
          in human or in animal form, and that a custom has prevailed of
          killing annually either the human or the animal representative of
          the god. The reason for thus killing the corn-spirit in the person
          of his representative has been given implicitly in the earlier part
          of this chapter. But, further, we have found a widespread custom of
          eating the god sacramentally, either in the shape of the man or
          animal who represents the god, or in the shape of bread made in
          human or animal form. The reasons for thus partaking of the body of
          the god are, from the primitive standpoint, simple enough. The
          savage commonly believes that by eating the flesh of an animal or
          man he acquires not only the physical, but even the moral and
          intellectual qualities which were characteristic of that animal or
          man. To take examples. The Creeks, Cherokees, and kindred tribes of
          North American Indians <span class="tei tei-q">“believe that nature
          is possessed of such a property, as to transfuse into men and
          animals the qualities, either of the food they use, or of those
          objects that are presented to their senses; he who feeds on venison
          is, according to their physical system, swifter and more sagacious
          than the man who lives on the flesh of the clumsy bear, or helpless
          dunghill fowls, the slow-footed tame cattle, or the heavy wallowing
          swine. This is the reason that several of their old men recommend,
          and say, that formerly their greatest chieftains observed a
          constant rule in their diet, and seldom ate of any animal of a
          gross quality, or heavy motion of body, fancying it conveyed a
          dulness through the whole system, and disabled them from exerting
          themselves <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg

          skin was removed entire and preserved with the feathers as a relic
          or for the purpose of making the festal garment or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">paelt</span></span>. The carcass was buried in
          a hole in the temple, and the old women gathered round the grave
          weeping and moaning bitterly, while they threw various kinds of
          seeds or pieces of food on it, crying out, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg
          091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          did you run away? Would you not have been better with us?”</span>
          and so on. They said that the Panes was a woman who had run off to
          the mountains and there been changed into a bird by the god
          Chinigchinich. They believed that though they sacrificed the bird
          annually, she came to life again and returned to her home in the
          mountains. Moreover they thought that <span class="tei tei-q">“as
          often as the bird was killed, it became multiplied; because every
          year all the different Capitanes celebrated the same feast of the
          Panes, and were firm in the opinion that the birds sacrificed were
          but one and the same female.”</span><a id="noteref_302" name=
          "noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unity in
          multiplicity thus postulated by the Californians is very noticeable
          and helps to explain their motive for killing the divine bird. The
          notion of the life of a species as distinct from that of an
          individual, easy and obvious as it seems to us, appears to be one
          which the Californian savage cannot grasp. He is unable to conceive
          the life of the species otherwise than as an individual life, and
          therefore as exposed to the same dangers and calamities which
          menace and finally destroy the life of the individual. Apparently
          he thinks that a species left to itself will grow old and die like
          an individual, and that therefore some step must be taken to save
          from extinction the particular species which he regards as divine.
          The only means he can think of to avert the catastrophe is to kill
          a member of the species in whose veins the tide of life is still
          running strong and has not yet stagnated among the fens of old age.
          The life thus diverted from one channel will flow, he fancies, more
          freshly and freely in a new one; in other words, the slain animal
          will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name=
          "Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> revive and enter on
          a new term of life with all the spring and energy of youth. To us
          this reasoning is transparently absurd, but so too is the custom.
          If a better explanation, that is, one more consonant with the facts
          and with the principles of savage thought, can be given of the
          custom, I will willingly withdraw the one here proposed. A similar
          confusion, it may be noted, between the individual life and the
          life of the species was made by the Samoans. Each family had for
          its god a particular species of animal; yet the death of one of
          these animals, for example an owl, was not the death of the god,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“he was supposed to be yet alive, and
          incarnate in all the owls in existence.”</span><a id="noteref_303"
          name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rude
          Californian rite which we have just considered has a close parallel
          in the religion of ancient Egypt. The Thebans and all other
          Egyptians who worshipped the Theban god Ammon held rams to be
          sacred and would not sacrifice them. But once a year at the
          festival of Ammon they killed a ram, skinned it, and clothed the
          image of the god in the skin. Then they mourned over the ram and
          buried it in a sacred tomb. The custom was explained by a story
          that Zeus had once exhibited himself to Hercules clad in the fleece
          and wearing the head of a ram.<a id="noteref_304" name=
          "noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> Of
          course the ram in this case was simply the beast-god of Thebes, as
          the wolf was the beast-god of Lycopolis, and the goat was the
          beast-god of Mendes. In other words, the ram was Ammon himself. On
          the monuments, it is true, Ammon appears in semi-human form with
          the body of a man and the head of a ram.<a id="noteref_305" name=
          "noteref_305" href="#note_305"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> But
          this only shows that he was in the usual <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> chrysalis state through which beast-gods
          regularly pass before they emerge as full-fledged anthropomorphic
          gods. The ram, therefore, was killed, not as a sacrifice to Ammon,
          but as the god himself, whose identity with the beast is plainly
          shown by the custom of clothing his image in the skin of the slain
          ram. The reason for thus killing the ram-god annually may have been
          that which I have assigned for the general custom of killing the
          god and for the special Californian custom of killing the divine
          buzzard. As applied to Egypt, this explanation is supported by the
          analogy of the bull-god Apis, who was not suffered to outlive a
          certain term of years.<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href=
          "#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a> The
          intention of thus putting a limit to the life of the god was, as I
          have argued, to secure him from the weakness and frailty of age.
          The same reasoning would explain the custom—probably an older
          one—of putting the beast-god to death annually, as was done with
          the ram of Thebes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One point in the
          Theban ritual—the application of the skin to the image of the
          god—deserves special attention. If the god was at first the living
          ram, his representation by an image must have originated later. But
          how did it originate? The answer to this question is perhaps
          furnished by the practice of preserving the skin of the animal
          which is slain as divine. The Californians, as we have seen,
          preserved the skin of the buzzard; and the skin of the goat, which
          is killed on the harvest-field as a representative of the
          corn-spirit, is kept for various superstitious purposes.<a id=
          "noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a> The
          skin in fact was kept as a token or memorial of the god, or rather
          as containing in it a part of the divine life, and it had only to
          be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name=
          "Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stuffed or stretched
          upon a frame to become a regular image of him. At first an image of
          this kind would be renewed annually,<a id="noteref_308" name=
          "noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> the
          new image being provided by the skin of the slain animal. But from
          annual images to permanent images the transition is easy. We have
          seen that the older custom of cutting a new May-tree every year was
          superseded by the practice of maintaining a permanent May-pole,
          which was, however, annually decked with fresh leaves and flowers
          and even surmounted each year by a fresh young tree.<a id=
          "noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a>
          Similarly when the stuffed skin, as a representative of the god,
          was replaced by a permanent image of him in wood, stone, or metal,
          the permanent image was annually clad in the fresh skin of the
          slain animal. When this stage had been reached, the custom of
          killing the ram came naturally to be interpreted as a sacrifice
          offered to the image, and was explained by a story like that of
          Ammon and Hercules.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">West Africa
          furnishes another example of the annual killing of a sacred animal
          and the preservation of its skin. The negroes of Issapoo, in the
          island of Fernando Po, regard the cobra-capella as their guardian
          deity, who can do them good or ill, bestow riches or inflict
          disease and death. The skin of one of these reptiles is hung tail
          downwards from a branch of the highest tree in the public square,
          and the placing of it on the tree is an annual ceremony. As soon as
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name=
          "Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the ceremony is
          over, all children born within the past year are carried out and
          their hands made to touch the tail of the serpent's skin.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a> The
          latter custom is clearly a way of placing the infants under the
          protection of the tribal god. Similarly in Senegambia a python is
          expected to visit every child of the Python clan within eight days
          after birth;<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href=
          "#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> and
          the Psylli, a Snake clan of ancient Africa, used to expose their
          infants to snakes in the belief that the snakes would not harm
          true-born children of the clan.<a id="noteref_312" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          Californian, Egyptian, and Fernando Po customs the animal slain
          probably is, or once was, a totem. At all events, in all three
          cases the worship of the animal seems to have no relation to
          agriculture, and may therefore be presumed to date from the hunter
          or pastoral stage of society. The same may be said of the following
          custom, though the people who practise it—the Zuni Indians of New
          Mexico—are now settled in walled villages or towns of a peculiar
          type, and practise agriculture and the arts of pottery and weaving.
          But the Zuni custom is marked by certain features which appear to
          place it in a somewhat different category from the preceding cases.
          It may be well therefore to describe it at full length in the words
          of an eye-witness.</p>

          buttons, and what not for savage ornament.... One day as I sat
          watching him, a procession of fifty men went hastily down the hill,
          and off westward over the plain. They were solemnly led by a
          painted and shell-bedecked priest, and followed by the
          torch-bearing Shu-lu-wit-si, or God of Fire. After they had
          vanished, I asked old brother what it all meant.</span></p>

          pathway, each bearing in his arms a basket filled with living,
          squirming turtles, which he regarded and carried as tenderly as a
          mother would her infant. Some of the wretched reptiles were
          carefully wrapped in soft blankets, their heads and forefeet
          protruding,—and, mounted on the backs of the plume-bedecked
          pilgrims, made ludicrous but solemn caricatures of little children
          in the same position. While I was at supper upstairs that evening,
          the governor's brother-in-law came in. He was welcomed by the
          family as if a messenger from heaven. He bore in his tremulous
          fingers one of the much abused and rebellious turtles. Paint still
          adhered to his hands and bare feet, which led me to infer that he

          tenderly laid the turtle on the floor. No sooner did <span class=

          accord the family forsook dish, spoon, and drinking-cup, and
          grabbing from a sacred meal-bowl whole handfuls of the contents,
          hurriedly followed the turtle about the room, into dark corners,
          around water-jars, behind the grinding-troughs, and out into the
          middle of the floor again, praying and scattering meal on its back
          as they went. At last, strange to say, it approached the footsore
          man who had brought it.</span></p>

          he inhaled from his palm deeply and long, at the same time invoking
          the favour of the gods. Then he leaned his chin upon his hand, and
          with large wistful eyes regarded his ugly captive as it sprawled
          about, blinking its meal-bedimmed eyes, and clawing the smooth
          floor in memory of its native element. At this juncture I ventured
          a question:</span></p>

          brother to have been! Who knows which? Maybe my own

          weeping most pathetically, and, tremulous with sobs, which were
          echoed by the women and children, he buried his face in his hands.
          Filled with sympathy for his grief, however mistaken, I raised the
          turtle to my lips and kissed its cold shell; then depositing it on
          the floor, hastily left the grief-stricken family to their sorrows.
          Next day, with prayers and tender beseechings, plumes, and
          offerings, the poor turtle was killed, and its flesh and bones were
          removed and deposited in the little river, that it might

          and, covered by a piece of buckskin, it still hangs from the

          buy it for a ladle; loaded with indignant reproaches, he was turned

          we find expressed in the clearest way a belief in the
          transmigration of human souls into the bodies of turtles.<a id=

          same belief in transmigration <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> is held by the Moqui Indians, who belong to
          the same race as the Zunis. The Moquis are divided into totem
          clans—the Bear clan, Deer clan, Wolf clan, Hare clan, etc.; they
          believe that the ancestors of the clans were bears, deer, wolves,
          hares, etc.; and that at death the members of each clan become
          bears, deer, etc.<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href=
          "#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a> The
          Zuni are also divided into clans, the totems of which agree closely
          with those of the Moquis, and one of their totems is the
          turtle.<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a> Thus
          their belief in transmigration into the turtle is probably one of
          the regular articles of their totem faith. What then is the meaning
          of killing a turtle in which the soul of a kinsman is believed to
          be present? Apparently the object is to keep up a communication
          with the other world in which the souls of the departed are
          believed to be assembled in the form of turtles. It is a common
          belief that the spirits of the dead return occasionally to their
          old homes; and accordingly the unseen visitors are welcomed and
          feasted by the living, and then sent upon their way.<a id=
          "noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a> In
          the Zuni ceremony the dead are fetched back in the form of turtles,
          and the killing of the turtles is the way of sending back the souls
          to the spirit-land. Thus the general explanation given above of the
          custom of killing a god seems inapplicable to the Zuni custom, the
          true meaning of which is somewhat obscure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Doubt also hangs
          over the meaning of the bear-sacrifice offered by the Ainos, a
          primitive people <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg

          who are found in the Japanese islands of Yesso and Saghalien, and
          also in the southern of the Kurile Islands. It is not quite easy to
          make out the attitude of the Ainos towards the bear. On the one
          hand they give it the name of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          it is expressly said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The live fox is

          bear cannot, therefore, be described as a sacred animal of the
          Ainos, and it certainly is not a totem; for they do not call
          themselves bears, they appear to have no legend of their descent
          from a bear,<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href=

          they kill and eat the animal freely.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is the
          bear-festival of the Ainos which concerns us here. Towards the end
          of winter a young bear is caught and brought into the village. At
          first he is suckled by an Aino woman; afterwards he is fed on fish.
          When he grows so strong that he threatens to break out of the
          wooden cage in which he is confined, the feast is held. But
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it is a peculiarly <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> striking fact that the young bear is
          not kept merely to furnish a good meal; rather he is regarded and
          honoured as a fetish, or even as a sort of higher
          being.”</span><a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href=
          "#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a> The
          festival is generally celebrated in September or October. Before it
          takes place the Ainos apologise to their gods, alleging that they
          have treated the bear kindly as long as they could, now they can
          feed him no longer, and are obliged to kill him. A man who gives a
          bear-feast invites his relations and friends; in a small village
          nearly the whole community takes part in the feast. One of these
          festivals has been described by an eyewitness, Dr. Scheube.<a id=
          "noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a> On
          entering the hut he found about thirty Ainos present, men, women,
          and children, all dressed in their best. The master of the house
          first offered a libation on the fireplace to the god of the fire,
          and the guests followed his example. Then a libation was offered to
          the house-god in his sacred corner of the hut. Meanwhile the
          housewife, who had nursed the bear, sat by herself, silent and sad,
          bursting now and then into tears. Her grief was obviously
          unaffected, and it deepened as the festival went on. Next, the
          master of the house and some of the guests went out of the hut and
          offered libations before the bear's cage. A few drops were
          presented to the bear in a saucer, which he at once upset. Then the
          women and girls danced round the cage, their faces turned towards
          it, their knees slightly bent, rising and hopping on their toes. As
          they danced they clapped their hands and sang a monotonous song.
          The housewife and a few old women, who might have nursed many
          bears, danced tearfully, stretching out their arms to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the bear, and addressing it in terms of
          endearment. The young folks were less affected; they laughed as
          well as sang. Disturbed by the noise, the bear began to rush about
          his cage and howl lamentably. Next libations were offered to the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inabos</span></span> or sacred wands which
          stand outside of an Aino hut. These wands are about a couple of
          feet high, and are whittled at the top into spiral shavings.<a id=
          "noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> Five
          new wands with bamboo leaves attached to them had been set up for
          the festival. This is regularly done when a bear is killed; the
          leaves mean that the bear may come to life again. Then the bear was
          let out of his cage, a rope was thrown round his neck, and he was
          led about in the neighbourhood of the hut. While this was being
          done the men, headed by a chief, shot at the bear with arrows
          tipped with wooden buttons. Dr. Scheube had to do so also. Then the
          bear was taken before the sacred wands, a stick was put in his
          mouth, nine men knelt on him and pressed his neck against a beam.
          In five minutes the bear had expired without uttering a sound.
          Meantime the women and girls had taken post behind the men, where
          they danced, lamenting, and beating the men who were killing the
          bear. The bear's carcass was next placed on a mat before the sacred
          wands; and a sword and quiver, taken from the wands, were hung
          round the beast's neck. Being a she-bear, it was also adorned with
          a necklace and ear-rings. Then food and drink were offered to it,
          in the shape of millet-broth, millet-cakes, and a pot of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sake</span></span>. The men now sat down on
          mats before the dead bear, offered libations to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it, and drank deep. Meanwhile the women
          and girls had laid aside all marks of sorrow, and danced merrily,
          none more merrily than the old women. When the mirth was at its
          height two young Ainos, who had let the bear out of his cage,
          mounted the roof of the hut and threw cakes of millet among the
          company, who all scrambled for them without distinction of age or
          sex. The bear was next skinned and disembowelled, and the trunk
          severed from the head, to which the skin was left hanging. The
          blood, caught in cups, was eagerly swallowed by the men. None of
          the women or children appeared to drink the blood, though custom
          did not forbid them to do so. The liver was cut in small pieces and
          eaten raw, with salt, the women and children getting their share.
          The flesh and the rest of the vitals were taken into the house to
          be kept till the next day but one, and then to be divided among the
          persons who had been present at the feast. Blood and liver were
          offered to Dr. Scheube. While the bear was being disembowelled, the
          women and girls danced the same dance which they had danced at the
          beginning—not, however, round the cage, but in front of the sacred
          wands. At this dance the old women, who had been merry a moment
          before, again shed tears freely. After the brain had been extracted
          from the bear's head and swallowed with salt, the skull, detached
          from the skin, was hung on a pole beside the sacred wands. The
          stick with which the bear had been gagged was also fastened to the
          pole, and so were the sword and quiver which had been hung on the
          carcass. The latter were removed in about an hour, but the rest
          remained standing. The whole company, men and women, danced noisily
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name=
          "Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> before the pole; and
          another drinking-bout, in which the women joined, closed the
          festival.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mode of
          killing the bear is described somewhat differently by Miss Bird,
          who, however, did not witness the ceremony. She says: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yells and shouts are used to excite the bear; and when
          he becomes much agitated a chief shoots him with an arrow,
          inflicting a slight wound which maddens him, on which the bars of
          the cage are raised, and he springs forth, very furious. At this
          stage the Ainos run upon him with various weapons, each one
          striving to inflict a wound, as it brings good luck to draw his
          blood. As soon as he falls down exhausted his head is cut off, and
          the weapons with which he has been wounded are offered to it, and
          he is asked to avenge himself upon them.”</span> At Usu, on Volcano
          Bay, when the bear is being killed, the Ainos shout, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We kill you, O bear! come back soon into an
          Aino.”</span><a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href=

          very respectable authority, Dr. Siebold, states that the bear's own
          heart is frequently offered to the dead animal, in order to assure
          him that he is still in life.<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337"

          family. He is then taken into every house in the village, where
          fish, brandy, etc. are offered to him. Some people prostrate
          themselves before the beast. His entrance into a house is supposed
          to bring a blessing; and if he snuffs at the food offered to him,
          this also is a blessing. Nevertheless they tease and worry, poke
          and tickle the animal continually, so that he is surly and
          snappish.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href=

          being thus taken to every house, he is tied to a peg and shot dead
          with arrows. His head is then cut off, decked with shavings, and
          placed on the table where the feast is set out. Here they beg
          pardon of the beast and worship him. Then his flesh is roasted and
          eaten in special vessels of wood finely carved. They do not eat the
          flesh raw nor drink the blood, as the Ainos do. The brain and
          entrails are eaten last; and the skull, still decked with shavings,
          is placed on a tree near the house. Then the people sing and both
          sexes dance in ranks, as bears.<a id="noteref_342" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Goldi,
          neighbours of the Gilyaks, treat the bear in much the same way.
          They hunt and kill it; but sometimes they capture a live bear and
          keep him in a cage, feeding him well and calling him their son and
          brother. Then at a great festival he is taken from his cage,
          paraded about with marked consideration, and afterwards killed and
          eaten. <span class="tei tei-q">“The skull, jaw-bones, and ears are
          then suspended on a tree, as an antidote against evil spirits; but
          the flesh is eaten and much relished, for they believe that all who
          partake of it acquire a zest for the chase, and become
          courageous.”</span><a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the treatment
          of the captive bear by these tribes there are features which can
          hardly be distinguished from worship. Such in particular is the
          Gilyak custom of leading him from house to house, that every family
          may receive his blessing—a custom parallel to the European one of
          taking a May-tree or a personal representative of the tree-spirit
          from door to door in spring, in order that all may share the fresh
          energies of reviving nature. Again the expected resurrection of the
          bear is avowedly indicated by the bamboo leaves and by the prayer
          addressed to him to <span class="tei tei-q">“come back soon into an
          Aino.”</span> And that the eating of his flesh is regarded as a
          sacrament is made probable by the Gilyak custom of reserving
          special vessels to hold the bear's flesh on this solemn occasion.
          How is the reverence thus paid to particular bears to be reconciled
          with the fact that bears in general are habitually hunted and
          killed by these tribes for the sake of their flesh and skins? On
          the one hand, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg
          108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          bear is treated as a god; on the other hand, as a creature wholly
          subservient to human needs. The apparent contradiction vanishes
          when we place ourselves at the savage point of view. The savage, we
          must remember, believes that animals are endowed with feelings and
          intelligence like those of men, and that, like men, they possess
          souls which survive the death of their bodies either to wander
          about as disembodied spirits or to be born again in animal form. To
          the savage, therefore, who regards all living creatures as
          practically on a footing of equality with man,<a id="noteref_344"
          name="noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a> the
          act of killing and eating an animal must wear a very different
          aspect from that which the same act presents to us who regard the
          intelligence of animals as far inferior to our own and deny them
          the possession of immortal souls. Thus on the principles of his
          rude philosophy the savage who slays an animal believes himself
          exposed to the vengeance either of its disembodied spirit or of all
          the other animals of the same species, whom he considers as knit
          together, like men, by the ties of kin and the obligations of the
          blood feud, and therefore as bound to resent the injury done to one
          of their number. Accordingly the savage makes it a rule to spare
          the life of those animals which he has no pressing motive for
          killing, at least such fierce and dangerous animals as are likely
          to exact a bloody vengeance for the slaughter of one of their kind.
          Crocodiles are animals of this sort. They are only found in hot
          countries where, as a rule, food is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> abundant and primitive man has therefore no
          reason to kill them for the sake of their tough and unpalatable
          flesh. Hence it is a general rule among savages to spare
          crocodiles, or rather only to kill them in obedience to the law of
          blood feud, that is, as a retaliation for the slaughter of men by
          crocodiles. For example, the Dyaks of Borneo will not kill a
          crocodile unless a crocodile has first killed a man. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“For why, say they, should they commit an act of
          aggression, when he and his kindred can so easily repay them? But
          should the alligator take a human life, revenge becomes a sacred
          duty of the living relatives, who will trap the man-eater in the
          spirit of an officer of justice pursuing a criminal. Others, even
          then, hang back, reluctant to embroil themselves in a quarrel which
          does not concern them. The man-eating alligator is supposed to be
          pursued by a righteous Nemesis; and whenever one is caught they
          have a profound conviction that it must be the guilty one, or his
          accomplice.”</span><a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href=

          people of the neighbourhood have been known to go by night to the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the savage
          clearly cannot afford to spare all animals. He must either eat some
          of them or starve, and when the question thus comes to be whether
          he or the animal must perish, he is forced to overcome his
          superstitious scruples and take the life of the beast. At the same
          time he does all he can to appease his victims and their kinsfolk.
          Even in the act of killing them he testifies his respect for them,
          endeavours to excuse or even conceal his share in procuring their
          death, and promises that their remains will be honourably treated.
          By thus robbing death of its terrors he hopes to reconcile his
          victims to their fate and to induce their fellows to come and be
          killed also. For example, it was a principle with the Kamtchatkans
          never to kill a land or sea animal without first making excuses to
          it and begging that the animal would not <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> take it ill. Also they offered it cedar-nuts,
          etc. to make it think that it was not a victim but a guest at a
          feast. They believed that this prevented other animals of the same
          species from growing shy. For instance, after they had killed a
          bear and feasted on its flesh, the host would bring the bear's head
          before the company, wrap it in grass, and present it with a variety
          of trifles. Then he would lay the blame of the bear's death on the
          Russians, and bid the beast wreak his wrath upon them. Also he
          would ask the bear to tell the other bears how well he had been
          treated, that they too might come without fear. Seals, sea-lions,
          and other animals were treated by the Kamtchatkans with the same
          ceremonious respect.<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href=

          the Ostiaks have hunted and killed a bear, they cut off its head
          and hang it on a tree. Then they gather round in a circle and pay
          it divine honours. Next they run towards the carcass uttering
          lamentations and saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who killed you?
          It was the Russians. Who cut off your head? It was a Russian axe.
          Who skinned you? It was a knife made by a Russian.”</span> They
          explain, too, that the feathers which sped the arrow on its flight
          came from the wing of a strange bird, and that they did nothing but
          let the arrow go. They do all this because they believe that the
          wandering ghost of the slain bear would attack them on the first
          opportunity, if they did not thus appease it.<a id="noteref_351"

          traced all along the northern region of the Old World, from
          Behring's Straits to Lappland. It reappears in similar forms in
          North America. With the American Indians a bear hunt was an
          important event for which they prepared by long fasts and
          purgations. Before setting out they offered expiatory sacrifices to
          the souls of bears slain in previous hunts, and besought them to be
          favourable to the hunters. When a bear was killed the hunter
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name=

          putting the mouth of it between the bear's lips, blew into the
          bowl, filling the beast's mouth with smoke. Then he begged the bear
          not to be angry at having been killed, and not to thwart him
          afterwards in the chase. The carcass was roasted whole and eaten;
          not a morsel of the flesh might be left over. The head, painted red

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is not
          merely dangerous animals with whom the savage desires to keep on
          good terms. It is true that the respect which he pays to wild
          beasts is in some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg
          115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          measure proportioned to their strength and ferocity. Thus the
          savage Stiens of Cambodia, believing that all animals have souls
          which roam about after their death, beg an animal's pardon when
          they kill it, lest its soul should come and torment them. Also they
          offer it sacrifices, but these sacrifices are proportioned to the
          size and strength of the animal. The ceremonies observed at the
          death of an elephant are conducted with much pomp and last seven
          days.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href=

          Similar distinctions are drawn by North American Indians.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The bear, the buffalo, and the beaver are
          manidos [divinities] which furnish food. The bear is formidable,
          and good to eat. They render ceremonies to him, begging him to
          allow himself to be eaten, although they know he has no fancy for
          it. We kill you, but you are not annihilated. His head and paws are
          objects of homage.... Other animals are treated similarly from
          similar reasons.... Many of the animal manidos, not being
          dangerous, are often treated with contempt—the terrapin, the
          weasel, polecat, etc.”</span><a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> The
          distinction is instructive. Animals which are feared, or are good
          to eat, or both, are treated with ceremonious respect; those which
          are neither formidable nor good to eat are despised. We have had
          examples of reverence paid to animals which are both feared and
          eaten. It remains to prove that similar respect is shown for
          animals which, without being feared, are either eaten or valued for
          their skins.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Siberian
          sable-hunters have caught a sable, no one is allowed to see it, and
          they think that if good or evil be spoken of the captured sable, no
          more sables <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg

          the sables could hear what was said of them as far off as Moscow.
          He said that the chief reason why the sable hunt was now so
          unproductive was that some live sables had been sent to Moscow.
          There they had been viewed with astonishment as strange animals,
          and the sables cannot abide that. Another, though minor, cause of
          the diminished take of sable was, he alleged, that the world is now
          much worse than it used to be, so that nowadays a hunter will
          sometimes hide the sable which he has got instead of putting it
          into the common stock. This also, said he, the sables cannot
          abide.<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“lest the spirits who look after the

          Canadian Indians were equally particular not to let their dogs gnaw
          the bones, or at least certain of the bones, of beavers. They took
          the greatest pains to collect and preserve these bones and, when
          the beaver had been caught in a net, they threw them into the
          river. To a Jesuit who argued that the beavers could not possibly
          know what became of their bones, the Indians replied, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You know nothing about catching beavers and yet you
          will be talking about it. Before the beaver is stone dead, his soul
          takes a turn in the hut of the man who is killing him and makes a
          careful note of what is done with his bones. If the bones are given
          to the dogs, the other beavers would get word of it and would not
          let themselves be caught. Whereas, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Before hunting the beaver they offered a solemn prayer to the Great
          Beaver, and presented him with tobacco; and when the chase was
          over, an orator pronounced a funeral oration over the dead beavers.
          He praised their spirit and wisdom. <span class="tei tei-q">“You
          will hear no more,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“the

          creature from her and tenderly caressed and fondled it. Being asked
          why he did so, he said that it was to appease the genius of mice,
          in order that he might not torment his daughter for eating the

          reasons, a tribe which depends for its subsistence, chiefly or in

          honour and respect. The Indians of Peru <span class=

          took care to send them plenty of its children to sustain their

          where they killed more of them than of any other fish; in others,
          the skate; in others, the dogfish; in others, the golden fish for
          its beauty; in others, the crawfish; in others, for want of larger
          gods, the crabs, where they had no other fish, or where they knew
          not how to catch and kill them. In short, they had whatever fish

          the souls of the fish should go and warn the other fish not to let
          themselves be caught, since the Hurons would burn their bones.
          Moreover, they had men who preached to the fish and persuaded them
          to come and be caught. A good preacher was much sought after, for
          they thought that the exhortations of a clever man had a great
          effect in drawing the fish to the nets. In the Huron fishing
          village where the French missionary Sagard stayed, the preacher to
          the fish prided himself very much on his eloquence, which was of a
          florid order. Every evening after supper, having seen that all the
          people were in their places and that a strict silence was observed,
          he preached to the fish. His text was that the Hurons did not burn
          fish bones. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then enlarging on his theme

          given to the first of their kind which is taken. Accordingly the

          begin to run up the Klamath river, the Karoks of California dance
          for salmon, to ensure a good catch. One of the Indians, called the
          Kareya or God-man, retires to the mountains and fasts for ten days.
          On his return the people flee, while he goes to the river, takes
          the first salmon of the catch, eats some of it, and with the rest
          kindles the sacred fire in the sweating-house. <span class=

          The Karoks also believe that a fisherman will take no salmon if the
          poles of which his spearing-booth is made were gathered on the
          river-side, where the salmon might have seen them. The poles must
          be brought from the top of the highest mountain. The fisherman will
          also labour in vain if he uses the same poles a second year in

          flesh, and thus the animal will come to life again. It is,
          therefore, clearly for the interest of the hunter to leave the
          bones intact, since to destroy them would be to diminish the future
          supply of game. Many of the Minnetaree Indians <span class=

          sacrificing an animal the Lapps regularly put aside the bones,
          eyes, ears, heart, lungs, sexual parts (if the animal was a male),
          and a morsel of flesh from each limb. Then, after eating the rest
          of the flesh, they laid the bones etc. in anatomical order in a
          coffin and buried them with the usual rites, believing that the god
          to whom the animal was sacrificed would reclothe the bones with
          flesh and restore the animal to life in Jabme-Aimo, the
          subterranean world of the dead. Sometimes, as after feasting on a
          bear, they seem to have contented themselves with thus burying the
          bones.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href=

          the Lapps expected the resurrection of the slain animal to take

          North American Indians looked for the resurrection of the animals
          in the present world. The habit, observed especially by Mongolian

          points rather to a belief in a resurrection of the latter sort. The

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the same species and offending the
          ghosts of the slain animals. The reluctance of North American

          perhaps only a precaution to prevent the bones from being broken.
          There are traces in folk-tales of the same primitive belief that
          animals or men may come to life again, if only their bones are
          preserved; not uncommonly the animal or man in the story comes to
          life lame of a limb, because one of his bones has been eaten,
          broken, or lost.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
          certain rule observed by savage hunters and fishers which, obscure
          at first sight, may be explained by this savage belief in
          resurrection. A traveller in America in the early part of this
          century was told by a half-breed Choctaw that the Indians
          <span class="tei tei-q">“had an obscure story, somewhat resembling
          that of Jacob wrestling with an angel; and that the full-blooded
          Indians always separate the sinew which shrank, and that it is
          never seen in the venison exposed for sale; he did not know what
          they did with it. His elder brother, whom I afterwards met, told me
          that they eat it as a rarity; but I have also heard, though on less
          respectable authority, that they refrain from it, like the ancient
          Jews. A gentleman, who had lived on the Indian frontier, or in the
          nation, for ten or fifteen years, told me that he had often been
          surprised that the Indians always detached the sinew; but it had
          never occurred to him to inquire the reason.”</span><a id=

          Adair, who knew the Indians of the South Eastern States intimately,
          and whose theories appear not to have distorted his view of the
          facts, observes that <span class="tei tei-q">“when in the woods,
          the Indians cut a small piece out of the lower part of the thighs
          of the deer they kill, lengthways <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class=

          venison-hams they bring to our trading houses, I do not remember to
          have observed one without it.... And I have been assured by a
          gentleman of character, who is now an inhabitant of South Carolina,
          and well acquainted with the customs of the Northern Indians, that
          they also cut a piece out of the thigh of every deer they kill, and
          throw it away; and reckon it such a dangerous pollution to eat it
          as to occasion sickness and other misfortunes of sundry kinds,
          especially by spoiling their guns from shooting with proper force
          and direction.”</span><a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href=
          "#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a> In
          recent years the statement of Adair's informant has been confirmed
          by the French missionary Petitot, who has also published the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“obscure story”</span> to which Hodgson
          refers. The Loucheux and Hare-skin Indians who roam the bleak
          steppes and forests that stretch from Hudson's Bay to the Rocky
          Mountains, and northward to the frozen sea, are forbidden by custom
          to eat the sinew of the legs of animals. To explain this custom
          they tell the following <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred
          story.”</span> Once upon a time a man found a burrow of porcupines,
          and going down into it after the porcupines he lost his way in the
          darkness, till a kind giant called <span class="tei tei-q">“He who
          sees before and behind”</span> released him by cleaving open the
          earth. So the man, whose name was <span class="tei tei-q">“Fireless
          and Homeless,”</span> lived with the kind giant, and the giant
          hunted elans and beavers for him, and carried him about in the
          sheath of his flint knife. <span class="tei tei-q">“But know, my
          son,”</span> said the giant, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he who
          uses the sky as his head is angry with me, and has sworn my
          destruction. If he slays me the clouds will be tinged with my
          blood; they will be red with it, probably.”</span> Then he gave the
          man an axe made of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
          128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          tooth of a gigantic beaver, and went forth to meet his enemy. But
          from under the ice the man heard a dull muffled sound. It was a
          whale which was making this noise because it was naked and cold.
          Warned by the man, the giant went toward the whale, which took
          human shape, and rushed upon the giant. It was the wicked giant,
          the kind giant's enemy. The two struggled together for a long time,
          till the kind giant cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, my son!
          cut, cut the sinew of the leg.”</span> The man cut the sinew, and
          the wicked giant fell down and was slain. That is why the Indians
          do not eat the sinew of the leg. Afterwards, one day the sky
          suddenly grew red, so Fireless and Homeless knew that the kind
          giant was dead, and he wept.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403"
          href="#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a> This
          myth, it is almost needless to observe, does not really explain the
          custom. No people ever observed a custom because a mythical being
          was said to have once acted in a certain way. But, on the contrary,
          all peoples have invented myths to explain why they observed
          certain customs. Dismissing, therefore, the story of Fireless and
          Homeless as a myth invented to explain why the Indians abstain from
          eating a particular sinew, it may be suggested<a id="noteref_404"
          name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> that
          the original reason for observing the custom was a belief that the
          sinew in question was necessary to reproduction, and that deprived
          of it the slain animals could not come to life again and stock the
          steppes and prairies either of the present world or of the spirit
          land. We have seen that the resurrection <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of animals is a common article of savage
          faith, and that when the Lapps bury the skeleton of the male bear
          in the hope of its resurrection they are careful to bury the
          genital parts along with it.<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
          animals which primitive man dreads for their strength and ferocity,
          and those which he reveres on account of the benefits which he
          expects from them, there is another class of creatures which he
          sometimes deems it necessary to conciliate by worship and
          sacrifice. These are the vermin that infest the crops. To rid
          himself of these deadly foes the farmer has recourse to a thousand
          superstitious devices, of which, though many are meant to destroy
          or intimidate the vermin, others aim at propitiating them and
          persuading them by fair means to spare the fruits of the earth.
          Thus Esthonian peasants, in the Island of Oesel, stand in great awe
          of the weevil, an insect which is exceedingly destructive to the
          grain. They give it a euphemistic title, and if a child is about to
          kill a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg
          130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          weevil they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't do it; the more we
          hurt him, the more he hurts us.”</span> If they find a weevil they
          bury it in the earth instead of killing it. Some even put the
          weevil under a stone in the field and offer corn to it. They think
          that thus it is appeased and does less harm.<a id="noteref_406"

          Amongst the Saxons of Transylvania, in order to keep sparrows from
          the corn, the sower begins by throwing the first handful of seed
          backwards over his head, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“That is
          for you, sparrows.”</span> To guard the corn against the attacks of
          leaf-flies (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Erdflöhe</span></span>) he
          shuts his eyes and scatters three handfuls of oats in different
          directions. Having made this offering to the leaf-flies he feels
          sure that they will spare the corn. A Transylvanian way of securing
          the crops against all birds, beasts, and insects, is this: After he
          has finished sowing, the sower goes once more from end to end of
          the field imitating the gesture of sowing, but with an empty hand.
          As he does so he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I sow this for the
          animals; I sow it for everything that flies and creeps, that walks
          and stands, that sings and springs, in the name of God the Father,
          etc.”</span><a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href=

          following is a German way of freeing a garden from caterpillars.
          After sunset or at midnight the mistress of the house, or another
          female member of the family, walks all round the garden dragging a
          broom after her. She must not look behind her, and must keep
          murmuring, <span class="tei tei-q">“Good evening, Mother
          Caterpillar, you shall come with your husband to church.”</span>
          The garden gate is left open till the following morning.<a id=

          to unbounded indulgence, but aims at adopting a judicious
          compromise between the two; kind but firm, he tempers severity with
          mercy. An ancient Greek treatise on farming advises the husbandman
          who would rid his lands of mice to act thus: <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">‘I adjure you, ye mice here present, that

          the Gods I will rend you in seven pieces.’</span> Write this, and

          Sometimes the desired object is supposed to be attained by treating
          with high distinction one or two chosen individuals of the
          obnoxious species, while the rest are pursued with relentless
          rigour. In the East Indian island of Bali, the mice which ravage
          the rice-fields are caught in great numbers, and burned in the same
          way that corpses are burned. But two of the captured mice are
          allowed to live, and receive a little packet of white linen. Then
          the people bow down before them, as before gods, and let them

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these latter
          examples the deference shown to a few chosen individuals of the
          species is apparently regarded as entitling a person to exterminate
          with impunity all the rest of the species upon which he can lay
          hands. This principle perhaps explains the attitude, at first sight
          puzzling and contradictory, of the Ainos towards the bear. The
          flesh and skin of the bear regularly afford them food and clothing;
          but since the bear is an intelligent and powerful animal, it is
          necessary to offer some satisfaction or atonement to the bear
          species for the loss which it sustains in the death of so many of
          its members. This satisfaction or atonement is made by rearing
          young bears, treating them, so long as they live, with respect, and
          killing them with extraordinary marks of sorrow and devotion. Thus
          the other bears are appeased, and do not resent the slaughter of
          their kind by attacking the slayers or deserting the country, and
          thus depriving the Ainos of one of their means of
          subsistence.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
          primitive worship of animals assumes two forms, which are in some
          respects the converse of each other. On the one hand animals are
          respected, and are therefore neither killed nor eaten. Totemism is
          a form of this worship, if worship it can be called; but it is not
          the only form, for we have seen that dangerous and useless animals,
          like the crocodile, are commonly revered and spared by men who do
          not regard the animal in question as their totem. On the other hand
          animals are worshipped because they are habitually killed and
          eaten. In both forms of worship the animal is revered on account of
          some benefit, positive or negative, which the savage hopes to
          receive from it. In the former worship the benefit comes either in
          the positive form of protection, advice, and help which the animal
          affords the man, or in the negative one of abstinence from injuries
          which it is in the power of the animal to inflict. In the latter
          worship the benefit takes the material form of the animal's flesh
          and skin. The two forms of worship are in some measure
          antithetical: in the one, the animal is not eaten because it is
          revered; in the other, it is revered because it is eaten. But both
          may be practised by the same people, as we see in the case of the
          North American Indians, who, while they revere and spare their
          totem animals, also revere the animals and fish upon which they
          subsist. The aborigines of Australia have totemism in the most
          primitive form known to us, but, so far as I am aware, there is no
          evidence that they attempt, like the North American Indians, to
          conciliate the animals which they kill and eat. The means which the
          Australians adopt to secure a plentiful supply of game appear to be
          based not on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
          134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          conciliation, but on sympathetic magic,<a id="noteref_414" name=
          "noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a> a
          principle to which the North American Indians also resort for the
          same purpose.<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href=
          "#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> If
          this is so, it would appear that the totemistic respect for animals
          is older than the other, and that, before hunters think of
          worshipping the game as a means of ensuring an abundant supply of
          it, they seek to attain the same end by sympathetic magic. This,
          again, would show—what there is good reason for believing—that
          sympathetic magic is one of the earliest means by which man
          endeavours to adapt the agencies of nature to his needs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corresponding to
          the two distinct types of animal worship, there are two distinct
          types of the custom of killing the animal god. On the one hand,
          when the revered animal is habitually spared, it is nevertheless
          killed—and sometimes eaten—on rare and solemn occasions. Examples
          of this custom have been already given and an explanation of them
          offered. On the other hand, when the revered animal is habitually
          killed, the slaughter of any one of the species involves the
          killing of the god, and is atoned for on the spot by apologies and
          sacrifices, especially when the animal is a powerful and dangerous
          one; and, in addition to this ordinary and everyday atonement,
          there is a special annual atonement, at which a select individual
          of the species is slain with extraordinary marks of respect and
          devotion. Clearly the two types of sacramental killing—the Egyptian
          and the Aino types, as we may call them for distinction—are liable
          to be confounded by an observer; and, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> before we can say to which type any
          particular example belongs, it is necessary to ascertain whether
          the animal sacramentally slain belongs to a species which is
          habitually spared, or to one which is habitually killed by the
          tribe. In the former case the example belongs to the Egyptian type
          of sacrament, in the latter to the Aino type.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The practice of
          pastoral tribes appears to furnish examples of both types of
          sacrament. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pastoral tribes,”</span> says
          the most learned ethnologist of the day, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“being sometimes obliged to sell their herds to
          strangers who may handle the bones disrespectfully, seek to avert
          the danger which such a sacrilege would entail by consecrating one
          of the herd as an object of worship, eating it sacramentally in the
          family circle with closed doors, and afterwards treating the bones
          with all the ceremonious respect which, strictly speaking, should
          be accorded to every head of cattle, but which, being punctually
          paid to the representative animal, is deemed to be paid to all.
          Such family meals are found among various peoples, especially those
          of the Caucasus. When amongst the Abchases the shepherds in spring
          eat their common meal with their loins girt and their staffs in
          their hands, this may be looked upon both as a sacrament and as an
          oath of mutual help and support. For the strongest of all oaths is
          that which is accompanied with the eating of a sacred substance,
          since the perjured person cannot possibly escape the avenging god
          whom he has taken into his body and assimilated.”</span><a id=

          kind of sacrament <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg
          136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          is of the Aino or expiatory type, since it is meant to atone to the
          species for the possible ill-usage of individuals. An expiation,
          similar in principle but different in details, is offered by the
          Kalmucks to the sheep whose flesh is one of their staple foods.
          Rich Kalmucks are in the habit of consecrating a white ram under
          the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“the ram of heaven”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the ram of the spirit.”</span> The animal
          is never shorn and never sold; but when it grows old and its owner
          wishes to consecrate a new one, the old ram must be killed and
          eaten at a feast to which the neighbours are invited. On a lucky
          day, generally in autumn when the sheep are fat, a sorcerer kills
          the old ram, after sprinkling it with milk. Its flesh is eaten; the
          skeleton, with a portion of the fat, is burned on a turf altar; and
          the skin, with the head and feet, is hung up.<a id="noteref_417"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An example of a
          sacrament of the Egyptian type is furnished by the Todas, a
          pastoral people of Southern India, who subsist largely upon the
          milk of their buffaloes. Amongst them <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          buffalo is to a certain degree held sacred”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“is treated with great kindness, even with a degree of

          never eat the flesh of the cow buffalo, and as a rule abstain from
          the flesh of the male. But <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to the latter rule there is a single
          exception. Once a year all the adult males of the village join in
          the ceremony of killing and eating a very young male
          calf,—seemingly under a month old. They take the animal into the
          dark recesses of the village wood, where it is killed with a club
          made from the sacred tree of the Todas (the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tûde</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Millingtonia</span></span>). A sacred fire
          having been made by the rubbing of sticks, the flesh of the calf is
          roasted on the embers of certain trees, and is eaten by the men
          alone, women being excluded from the assembly. This is the only
          occasion on which the Todas eat buffalo flesh.<a id="noteref_419"

          Madi or Moru tribe of Central Africa, whose chief wealth is their
          cattle, though they also practice agriculture, appear to kill a
          lamb sacramentally on certain solemn occasions. The custom is thus
          described by Dr. Felkin. <span class="tei tei-q">“A remarkable
          custom is observed at stated times—once a year, I am led to
          believe. I have not been able to ascertain what exact meaning is
          attached to it. It appears, however, to relieve the people's minds,
          for beforehand they evince much sadness, and seem very joyful when
          the ceremony is duly accomplished. The following is what takes
          place: A large concourse of people of all ages assemble, and sit
          down round a circle of stones, which is erected by the side of a
          road (really a narrow path). A very choice lamb is then fetched by
          a boy, who leads it four times round the assembled people. As it
          passes they pluck off little bits of its fleece and place them in
          their hair, or on to some other part of their body. The lamb is
          then led up to the stones, and there killed by a man belonging to a
          kind of priestly order, who takes some of the blood and sprinkles
          it four times over the people. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> then applies it individually. On the children
          he makes a small ring of blood over the lower end of the breast
          bone, on women and girls he makes a mark above the breasts, and the
          men he touches on each shoulder. He then proceeds to explain the
          ceremony, and to exhort the people to show kindness.... When this
          discourse, which is at times of great length, is over, the people
          rise, each places a leaf on or by the circle of stones, and then
          they depart with signs of great joy. The lamb's skull is hung on a
          tree near the stones, and its flesh is eaten by the poor. This
          ceremony is observed on a small scale at other times. If a family
          is in any great trouble, through illness or bereavement, their
          friends and neighbours come together and a lamb is killed: this is
          thought to avert further evil. The same custom prevails at the
          grave of departed friends, and also on joyful occasions, such as
          the return of a son home after a very prolonged
          absence.”</span><a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href=

          sorrow thus manifested by the people at the annual slaughter of the
          lamb clearly indicates that the lamb slain is a divine animal,

          as the death of the sacred buzzard was mourned by the Californians
          and the death of the Theban ram by the Egyptians. The smearing each
          of the worshippers with the blood of the lamb is a form of
          communion with the divinity;<a id="noteref_422" name="noteref_422"

          communion in which the sacred animal is taken from house to house,
          that all may enjoy a share of its divine influence, has been
          exemplified by the Gilyak custom of promenading the bear through
          the village before it is slain. A similar form of communion with
          the sacred snake is observed by a Snake tribe in the Punjaub. Once
          a year in the month of September the snake is worshipped by all
          castes and religions for nine days only. At the end of August the
          Mirasans, especially those of the Snake tribe, make a snake of
          dough which they paint black and red, and place on a winnowing

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When every house
          has been thus visited, the dough snake is buried and a small grave
          is erected over it. Hither during the nine days of September the
          women <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name=
          "Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> come to worship.
          They bring a basin of curds, a small portion of which they offer at
          the snake's grave, kneeling on the ground and touching the earth
          with their foreheads. Then they go home and divide the rest of the
          curds among the children. Here the dough snake is clearly a
          substitute for a real snake. This is proved by the fact that in
          districts where snakes abound the worship is offered, not at the
          grave of the dough snake, but in the jungles where snakes are known
          to be. Besides this yearly worship performed by all the people, the
          members of the Snake tribe worship in the same way every morning
          after a new moon. The Snake tribe is not uncommon in the Punjaub.
          Members of it will not kill a snake and they say that its bite does
          not hurt them. If they find a dead snake, they put clothes on it
          and give it a regular funeral.<a id="noteref_423" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ceremonies
          closely analogous to this Indian worship of the snake have survived
          in Europe into recent times, and doubtless date from a very
          primitive paganism. The best-known example is the <span class=

          peoples—the ancient Greeks and Romans, the modern Italians,
          Spaniards, French, Germans, Dutch, Danes, Swedes, English, and
          Welsh—the wren has been designated the king, the little king, the
          king of birds, the hedge king, etc.,<a id="noteref_424" name=

          has been reckoned amongst those birds which it is extremely unlucky

          in Brittany, people believe that if children touch the young wrens
          in the nest, they will suffer from the fire of St. Lawrence, that
          is, from pimples on the face, legs, etc.<a id="noteref_428" name=

          other parts of France it is believed that if a person kills a wren
          or harries its nest, his house will be struck by lightning, or that
          the fingers with which he did the deed will shrivel up and drop
          off, or at least be maimed, or that his cattle will suffer in their

          Notwithstanding such beliefs, the custom of annually killing the
          wren has prevailed widely both in this country and in France. In
          the Isle of Man last century the custom was observed on Christmas
          Eve or rather Christmas morning. On the 24th of December, towards
          evening, all the servants got a holiday; they did not go to bed all
          night, but rambled about till the bells rang in all the churches at
          midnight. When prayers were over, they went to hunt the wren, and
          having found one of these birds they killed it and fastened it to
          the top of a long pole with its wings extended. Thus they carried
          it in procession to every house chanting the following rhyme—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After going from
          house to house and collecting all the money they could, they laid
          the wren on a bier <span class="tei tei-q">“with the utmost
          solemnity, singing dirges over her in the Manks language, which
          they call her knell; after which Christmas begins.”</span> After
          the burial the company outside the churchyard formed a circle and
          danced to music. About the middle of the present century the burial
          of the wren took place in the Isle of Man on St. Stephen's Day
          (December 26th). Boys went from door to door with a wren suspended
          by the legs in the centre of two hoops which crossed each other at
          right angles and were decorated with evergreens and ribbons. The
          bearers sang certain lines in which reference was made to boiling
          and eating the bird. If at the close of the song they received a
          small coin, they gave in return a feather of the wren; so that
          before the end of the day the bird often hung almost featherless.
          The wren was then buried, no longer in the churchyard, but on the
          sea-shore or in some waste place. The feathers distributed were
          preserved with religious care, it being believed that every feather
          was an effectual preservative from shipwreck for a year, and a
          fisherman would have been thought very foolhardy who had not one of
          them.<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href=

          half of this century similar customs were still observed in various
          parts of the south of France. Thus at Carcassone, every year on the
          first Sunday of December the young people of the street Saint Jean
          used to go out of the town armed with sticks, with which they beat
          the bushes, looking for wrens. The first to strike down one of
          these birds was proclaimed King. Then they returned to the town in
          procession, headed by the King, who carried the wren on a pole. On
          the evening of the last day of the year the King and all who had
          hunted the wren marched through the streets of the town with
          torches and music. At the door of every house they stopped,

          the year which was about to begin. On the morning of Twelfth Day
          the King again marched in procession with great pomp, wearing a
          crown and a blue mantle and carrying a sceptre. In front of him was
          borne the wren fastened to the top of a pole, which was adorned
          with a wreath of olive, oak, and mistletoe. After hearing high mass
          in the church, surrounded by his officers and guards, he visited
          the bishop, mayor, magistrates, and the chief inhabitants,
          collecting money to defray the expenses of the royal banquet which
          took place in the evening.<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434"

          Entraigues men and boys used to hunt the wren on Christmas Eve.
          When they caught one alive they presented it to the priest, who,
          after the midnight mass, set the bird free in the church. At
          Mirabeau the priest blessed the bird. If the men failed to catch a
          wren and the women succeeded in doing so, the women had the right
          to mock and insult the men, and to blacken their faces with mud and
          soot, if they caught them.<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435"

          pistols used to hunt the wren every year about the end of December.
          When a wren was caught it was hung on the middle of a pole which
          two men carried, as if it were a heavy burden. Thus they paraded
          round the town; the bird was weighed in a great pair of scales; and
          then the company sat down to table and made merry.<a id=

          between this custom of <span class="tei tei-q">“hunting the
          wren”</span> and some of those we have considered, especially the
          Gilyak procession with the bear, and the Indian one with the snake,
          seems too close to allow us to doubt that they all belong to the
          same circle of ideas. The worshipful animal is killed with special
          solemnity once a year; and before or immediately after death, he is
          promenaded from door to door, that each of his worshippers may
          receive a portion of the divine virtues that are supposed to
          emanate from the dead or dying god. Religious processions of this
          sort must have had a great place in the ritual of European peoples
          in prehistoric times, if we may judge from the numerous traces of
          them which have survived in folk-custom. A well-preserved specimen
          is the following, which survived in the Highlands of Scotland and
          in St. Kilda down to the latter half of last century. <span class=

          with staves, to the end of which bits of raw hide are tied. The

          learn that the hide of which pieces were burned in each house and
          applied to the inmates was the breast part of a sheep-skin.
          Formerly, perhaps, pieces of the cow-hide in which the man was clad
          were detached for this purpose, just as in the Isle of Man a
          feather of the wren used to be given to each household. Similarly,
          as we have seen, the human victim whom the Khonds slew as a
          divinity was taken from house to house, and every one strove to
          obtain a relic of his sacred person. Such customs are only another
          form of that communion with the deity which is attained most
          completely by eating the body and drinking the blood of the
          god.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg

          procession with the man clad in a cow-skin, there is nothing to
          show that the customs in question have any relation to agriculture.
          So far as appears, they may date from the pre-agricultural era when
          animals were revered as divine in themselves, not merely as divine
          because they embodied the corn-spirit; and the analogy of the
          Gilyak procession of the bear, and the Indian procession of the
          snake is in favour of assigning the corresponding European customs
          to this very early date. On the other hand, there are certain
          European processions of animals, or of men disguised as animals,
          which may possibly be purely agricultural in their origin;<a id=

          other words, the animals which figure in them may have been from
          the first nothing but representatives of the corn-spirit conceived
          in animal shape. But it is at least equally possible that these
          processions originated in the pre-agricultural era, and have only
          received an agricultural tinge from the environment in which they
          have so long survived. But the question is an obscure and difficult
          one, and cannot be here discussed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
          killing the god has now been proved to have been practised by
          peoples in the hunting, pastoral, and agricultural stages of
          society, and the various reasons for observing the custom have been
          explained. One aspect of the custom still remains to be noticed.
          The accumulated misfortunes and sins of the whole people are
          sometimes laid upon the dying god, who is supposed to bear them
          away for ever, leaving the people innocent and happy. The notion
          that we can transfer our pains and griefs to some other being who
          will bear them in our stead is familiar to the savage mind. It
          arises from a very obvious confusion between the physical and the
          mental. Because it is possible to transfer a load of wood, stones,
          or what not, from our own back to the back of another, the savage
          fancies that it is equally possible to transfer the burden of his
          pains and sorrows to another, who will suffer them in his stead.
          Upon this idea he acts, and the result is an endless number of
          often very unamiable devices for putting off upon some one else the
          trouble which a man shrinks from bearing himself. Such devices are
          amongst the most familiar facts in folk-lore; but for the benefit
          of readers who are not professed students of folk-lore, a few
          illustrations may be given.</p>

          necessary that the pain or trouble should be transferred from the

          a vehicle to convey the trouble to the first person who touches it.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old Welsh
          custom known as <span class="tei tei-q">“sin-eating”</span> is
          another example of the supposed transference of evil from one
          person to another. According to Aubrey, <span class="tei tei-q">“In
          the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to hire poor
          people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party
          deceased. One of them, I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse-high
          way (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal). The
          manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the house and
          layd on the Biere; a Loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered
          to the Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a Mazar-bowle of maple
          (Gossips bowle) full of beer, which he was to drinke up, and
          sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he took upon him (ipso
          facto) all the Sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from
          walking after they were dead.... I believe this custom was
          heretofore used over all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg

          Wales.... In North Wales the Sinne-eaters are frequently made use
          of; but there, instead of a Bowle of Beere, they have a bowle of

          According to a letter dated February 1, 1714-5, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in
          those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was
          notice given to an old sire (for so they called him), who presently
          repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the
          door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished
          him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they
          gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread,
          which he eat; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a
          draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced, with
          a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the soul departed for
          which he would pawn his own soul. This I had from the ingenious
          John Aubrey, Esq.”</span><a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465"

          Aubrey's statement is supported by the analogy of similar customs
          in India. When the Rajah <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg

          of Tanjore died in 1801, some of his bones and the bones of the two
          wives, who were burned with his corpse, were ground to powder and
          eaten, mixed with boiled rice, by twelve Brahmans. It was believed
          that the sins of the deceased passed into the bodies of the
          Brahmans, who were paid for the service.<a id="noteref_468" name=

          Brahman, resident in a village near Raipúr, stated that he had
          eaten food (rice and milk) out of the hand of the dead Rajah of
          Biláspúr, and that in consequence he had been placed on the throne
          for the space of a year. At the end of the year he had been given
          presents and then turned out of the territory and forbidden
          apparently to return. He was an outcast among his fellows for

          similar custom is believed to obtain among the hill states about
          Kángrá, and to have given rise to a caste of <span class=

          Chambá rice and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          of the corpse by a Brahman paid for the purpose. Afterwards a
          stranger, who had been caught outside the Chambá territory, was
          given the costly wrappings of the corpse, then told to depart and
          never show his face in the country again.<a id="noteref_470" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These examples
          illustrate the primitive principle of the transference of ills to
          another person, animal, or thing. In the instances cited the
          principle is applied for the benefit of individuals only. But
          analogous proceedings are employed by barbarous peoples to rid a
          whole community of all their troubles at a blow. The frame of mind
          which prompts such wholesale clearances of evil may be described in
          the language of Mr. Im Thurn, for though he wrote of the Indians of
          Guiana in particular, his description is capable of a much wider
          application. He says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus the whole world
          of the Indian swarms with these [spiritual] beings. If by a mighty
          mental effort we could for a moment revert to a similar mental
          position we should find ourselves surrounded by a host of possibly
          hurtful beings, so many in number that to describe them as
          innumerable would fall ridiculously short of the truth. It is not
          therefore wonderful that the Indian fears to move beyond the light
          of his camp-fire after dark, or, if he is obliged to do so, carries
          a firebrand with him that he may at least see among what enemies he
          walks; nor is it wonderful that occasionally the air round the
          settlement seems to the Indian to grow so full of beings that a
          peaiman [sorcerer], who is supposed to have the power of
          temporarily driving them away, is employed to effect a <span class=

          general clearances of evil influences may be divided into two
          classes, according as the expelled evils are immaterial and
          invisible or are embodied in a material vehicle or scapegoat. The
          former may be called the direct or immediate expulsion of evils;
          the latter the indirect or mediate expulsion, or the expulsion by
          scapegoat. We begin with examples of the former.</p>

          the author of the mishap. From the spot where the mishap took place
          they drive him step by step to the sea, and on reaching the shore
          they redouble their shouts and blows in order to expel him from the

          beginning of the rainy season, all the inhabitants of a district,
          armed with branches and clubs, go out by moonlight to the fields,
          where they beat and stamp on the ground with wild howls till

          a village has been visited by a series of disasters or a severe
          epidemic, the Minahassa of Celebes lay the blame upon the devils
          who are infesting the village and must be expelled from it.
          Accordingly, early one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg
          159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          morning all the people, men, women, and children, quit their homes,
          carrying their household goods with them, and take up their
          quarters in temporary huts which have been erected outside the
          village. Here they spend several days, offering sacrifices and
          preparing for the final ceremony. At last the men, some wearing
          masks, others with their faces blackened, and so on, but all armed
          with swords, guns, pikes, or brooms, steal cautiously and silently
          back to the deserted village. Then, at a signal from the priest,
          they rush furiously up and down the streets and into and under the
          houses (which are raised on piles above the ground), yelling and
          striking on walls, doors, and windows, to drive away the devils.
          Next, the priests and the rest of the people come with the holy
          fire and march nine times round each house and thrice round the
          ladder that leads up to it, carrying the fire with them. Then they
          take the fire into the kitchen, where it must burn for three days
          continuously. The devils are now driven away, and great and general
          is the joy.<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href=

          all the villagers he receives a costly garment and places it on
          four vessels, which he takes to the forest and leaves at the spot
          where the devil is supposed to be. Then with mocking words he bids

          disease, whereupon the people run back to the village at full

          Nias, when a man is seriously ill and other remedies have been
          tried in vain, the sorcerer proceeds to exorcise the devil who is
          causing the illness. A pole is set up in front of the house, and
          from the top of the pole a rope of palm-leaves is stretched to the
          roof of the house. Then the sorcerer mounts the roof with a pig,
          which he kills and allows to roll from the roof to the ground. The
          devil, anxious to get the pig, lets himself down hastily from the
          roof by the rope of palm-leaves, and a good spirit, invoked by the
          sorcerer, prevents him from climbing up again. If this remedy
          fails, it is believed that other devils must still be lurking in
          the house. So a general hunt is made after them. All the doors and
          windows in the house are closed, except a single dormer-window in
          the roof. The men, shut up in the house, hew and slash with their
          swords right and left to the clash of gongs and the rub-a-dub of
          drums. Terrified at this onslaught the devils escape by the
          dormer-window, and sliding down the rope of palm-leaves take
          themselves off. As all the doors and windows, except the one in the
          roof, are shut, the devils cannot get into the house again. In the
          case of an epidemic the proceedings are similar. All the gates of
          the village, except one, are closed; every voice is raised, every
          gong and drum beaten, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg

          every sword brandished. Thus the devils are driven out and the last
          gate is shut behind them. For eight days thereafter the village is
          in a state of siege, no one being allowed to enter it.<a id=

          about the village, breaking and upsetting whatever they came across
          in the wigwams. They threw fire and burning brands about the
          streets, and all night long they ran howling and singing without
          cessation. Then they all dreamed of something, a knife, dog, skin,
          or whatever it might be, and when morning came they went from
          wigwam to wigwam asking for presents. These they received silently,
          till the particular thing was given them which they had dreamed
          about. On receiving it they uttered a cry of joy and rushed from
          the hut, amid the congratulations of all present. The health of
          those who received what they had dreamed of was believed to be
          assured; whereas those who did not get what they had set their
          hearts upon regarded their fate as sealed.<a id="noteref_483" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The observance
          of such ceremonies, from being <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          comes to be thought desirable to have a general riddance of evil
          spirits at fixed times, usually once a year, in order that the
          people may make a fresh start in life, freed from all the malignant
          influences which have been long accumulating about them. Some of
          the Australian blacks annually expelled the ghosts of the dead from
          their territory. The ceremony was witnessed by the Rev. W. Ridley
          on the banks of the river Barwan. <span class="tei tei-q">“A chorus
          of twenty, old and young, were singing and beating time with
          boomerangs.... Suddenly, from under a sheet of bark darted a man
          with his body whitened by pipeclay, his head and face coloured with
          lines of red and yellow, and a tuft of feathers fixed by means of a
          stick two feet above the crown of his head. He stood twenty minutes
          perfectly still, gazing upwards. An aboriginal who stood by told me
          he was looking for the ghosts of dead men. At last he began to move
          very slowly, and soon rushed to and fro at full speed, flourishing
          a branch as if to drive away some foes invisible to us. When I
          thought this pantomime must be almost over, ten more, similarly
          adorned, suddenly appeared from behind the trees, and the whole
          party joined in a brisk conflict with their mysterious
          assailants.... At last, after some rapid evolutions in which they
          put forth all their strength, they rested from the exciting toil
          which they had kept up all night and for some hours after sunrise:
          they seemed satisfied that the ghosts were driven away for twelve
          months. They were performing the same ceremony at every station
          along the river, and I am told it is an annual
          custom.”</span><a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Certain seasons
          of the year mark themselves naturally out as appropriate moments
          for a general expulsion of devils. Such a moment occurs towards the
          close of an Arctic winter, when the sun reappears on the horizon
          after an absence of weeks or months. Accordingly, at Point Barrow,
          the most northerly extremity of Alaska, and nearly of America, the
          Eskimo choose the moment of the sun's reappearance to hunt the
          mischievous spirit Tuña from every house. The ceremony was
          witnessed a few years ago by the members of the United States Polar
          Expedition, who wintered at Point Barrow. A fire was built in front
          of the council-house, and an old woman was posted at the entrance
          to every <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">iglu</span></span> (Eskimo house). The men
          gathered round the council-fire, while the young women and girls
          drove the spirits out of every <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">iglu</span></span> with their knives, stabbing
          viciously under the bunk and deer-skins, and calling upon Tuña to
          leave the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">iglu</span></span>. When they thought he had
          been driven out of every hole and corner, they thrust him down
          through the hole in the floor and chased him into the open air with
          loud cries and frantic gestures. Meanwhile the old woman at the
          entrance of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">iglu</span></span> made passes with a long
          knife in the air to keep him from returning. Each party drove the
          spirit towards the fire and invited him to go into it. All were by
          this time drawn up in a semicircle round the fire, when several of
          the leading men made specific charges against the spirit; and each
          after his speech brushed his clothes violently, calling on the
          spirit to leave him and go into the fire. Two men now stepped
          forward with rifles loaded with blank cartridges, while a third
          brought a vessel of urine and flung it on the fire. At the same
          time one of the men fired a shot into the fire; and as the cloud of
          steam rose it received the other shot, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class=

          time being.<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href=

          autumn, when heavy gales are raging, the Eskimo of Baffin Land
          think that the female spirit Sedna dwells amongst them, and the
          most powerful enchanter is employed to drive her out. Beside a
          small hole in the centre of the floor a line of seal-skin is coiled
          up. Holding a sealing-spear in his left hand the enchanter watches
          the hole in the floor. Another sorcerer sits in the rear of the hut
          chanting songs to attract Sedna. Now she is heard approaching under
          the floor of the hut. When she reaches the hole the enchanter
          strikes her with his harpoon and pays out the line. A severe
          struggle ensues, but ultimately Sedna flies to her country,
          Adlivun. The performance is cleverly managed. When the harpoon is
          drawn out of the hole it is covered with blood, and the heavy
          breathing of Sedna can be distinctly heard under the floor.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Iroquois
          inaugurated the new year in January, February, or March (the time
          varied) with a <span class="tei tei-q">“festival of dreams”</span>
          like that which the Hurons observed on special occasions.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a> The
          whole ceremonies lasted several days, or even weeks, and formed a
          kind of Saturnalia. Men and women, variously disguised, went from
          wigwam to wigwam smashing and throwing down whatever they came
          across. It was a time of general licence; the people were supposed
          to be out of their senses, and therefore not to be responsible for
          what they did. Accordingly, many seized the opportunity of paying
          off old scores by belabouring obnoxious persons, drenching them
          with ice-cold water, and covering them with filth or hot ashes.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name=
          "Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Others seized
          burning brands or coals and flung them at the heads of the first
          persons they met. The only way of escaping from these persecutors
          was to guess what they had dreamed of. On one day of the festival
          the ceremony of driving away evil spirits from the village took
          place. Men clothed in the skins of wild beasts, their faces covered
          with hideous masks, and their hands with the shell of the tortoise,
          went from hut to hut making frightful noises; in every hut they
          took the fuel from the fire and scattered the embers and ashes
          about the floor with their hands. The general confession of sins
          which preceded the festival was probably a preparation for the
          public expulsion of evil influences; it was a way of stripping the
          people of their moral burdens, that these might be collected and
          cast out. This New Year festival is still celebrated by some of the
          heathen Iroquois, though it has been shorn of its former
          turbulence. A conspicuous feature in the ceremony is now the
          sacrifice of the White Dog, but this appears to have been added to
          the festival in comparatively modern times, and does not figure in
          the oldest descriptions of the ceremonies. We shall return to it
          later on.<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href=

          great annual festival of the Cherokee Indians was the Propitiation,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Cementation,”</span> or Purification
          festival. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was celebrated shortly after
          the first new moon of autumn, and consisted of a multiplicity of
          rigorous rites, fastings, ablutions, and purifications. Among the
          most important functionaries on the occasion were seven
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name=
          "Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> exorcisers or
          cleansers, whose duty it was, at a certain stage of the
          proceedings, to drive away evil, and purify the town. Each one bore
          in his hand a white rod of sycamore. <span class="tei tei-q">‘The
          leader, followed by the others, walked around the national
          heptagon, and coming to the treasure or store-house to the west of
          it, they lashed the eaves of the roofs with their rods. The leader
          then went to another house, followed by the others, singing, and
          repeated the same ceremony until every house was purified.’</span>
          This ceremony was repeated daily during the continuance of the
          festival. In performing their ablutions they went into the water
          and allowed their old clothes to be carried away by the stream, by
          which means they supposed their impurities removed.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In September the
          Incas of Peru celebrated a festival called Situa, the object of
          which was to banish from the capital and its vicinity all disease
          and troubles. The festival fell in September because the rains
          begin about this time, and with the first rains there was generally
          much sickness. As a preparation for the festival the people fasted
          on the first day of the moon after the autumnal equinox. Having
          fasted during the day, and the night being come, they baked a
          coarse paste of maize. This paste was made of two sorts. One was
          kneaded with the blood of children aged five to ten years, the
          blood being obtained by bleeding the children between the
          eye-brows. These two kinds of paste were baked separately, because
          they were for different uses. Each family assembled at the house of
          the eldest brother to celebrate the feast; and those who had no
          elder brother went to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg
          168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the house of their next relation of greater age. On the same night
          all who had fasted during the day washed their bodies, and taking a
          little of the blood-kneaded paste, rubbed it over their head, face,
          breast, shoulders, arms, and legs. They did this in order that the
          paste might take away all their infirmities. After this the head of
          the family anointed the threshold with the same paste, and left it
          there as a token that the inmates of the house had performed their
          ablutions and cleansed their bodies. Meantime the High Priest
          performed the same ceremonies in the temple of the Sun. As soon as
          the Sun rose, all the people worshipped and besought him to drive
          all evils out of the city, and then they broke their fast with the
          paste that had been kneaded without blood. When they had paid their
          worship and broken their fast, which they did at a stated hour, in
          order that all might adore the Sun as one man, an Inca of the blood
          royal came forth from the fortress, as a messenger of the Sun,
          richly dressed, with his mantle girded round his body, and a lance
          in his hand. The lance was decked with feathers of many hues,
          extending from the blade to the socket, and fastened with rings of
          gold. He ran down the hill from the fortress brandishing his lance,
          till he reached the centre of the great square, where stood the
          golden urn, like a fountain, that was used for the sacrifice of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chicha</span></span>. Here four other Incas of
          the blood royal awaited him, each with a lance in his hand, and his
          mantle girded up to run. The messenger touched their four lances
          with his lance, and told them that the Sun bade them, as his
          messengers, drive the evils out of the city. The four Incas then
          separated and ran down the four royal roads which led out of the
          city to the four quarters of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the world. While they ran, all the people,
          great and small, came to the doors of their houses, and with great
          shouts of joy and gladness shook their clothes, as if they were
          shaking off dust, while they cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
          the evils be gone. How greatly desired has this festival been by
          us. O Creator of all things, permit us to reach another year, that
          we may see another feast like this.”</span> After they had shaken
          their clothes, they passed their hands over their heads, faces,
          arms, and legs, as if in the act of washing. All this was done to
          drive the evils out of their houses, that the messengers of the Sun
          might banish them from the city. This was done not only in the
          streets through which the Incas ran, but generally in all quarters
          of the city. Moreover, they all danced, the Inca himself amongst
          them, and bathed in the rivers and fountains, saying that their
          maladies would come out of them. Then they took great torches of
          straw, bound round with cords. These they lighted, and passed from
          one to the other, striking each other with them, and saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Let all harm go away.”</span> Meanwhile
          the runners ran with their lances for a quarter of a league outside
          the city, where they found four other Incas ready, who received the
          lances from their hands and ran with them. Thus the lances were
          carried by relays of runners for a distance of five or six leagues,
          at the end of which the runners washed themselves and their weapons
          in rivers, and set up the lances, in sign of a boundary within
          which the banished evils might not return.<a id="noteref_490" name=

          Guinea annually banish the devil from all their towns with much
          ceremony. At Axim, on the Gold Coast, this annual expulsion is
          preceded by a feast of eight days, during which mirth and jollity
          reign, and <span class="tei tei-q">“a perfect lampooning liberty is

          with a dismal cry, running after him and pelting him with sticks,
          stones, and whatever comes to hand. When they have driven him far
          enough out of the town, they all return. In this way he is driven
          out of more than a hundred towns at the same time. To make sure
          that he does not return to their houses, the women wash and scour

          all Abyssinian festivals that of Mascal or the Cross is celebrated
          with the greatest pomp. The eve of the festival witnesses a
          ceremony which doubtless belongs to the world-wide class of customs
          we are dealing with. At sunset a discharge of firearms takes place
          from all the principal houses. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then every
          one provides himself with a torch, and during the early part of the
          night bonfires are kindled, and the people parade the town,

          their houses too, poking a light into every dark corner in the
          hall, under the couches, in the stables, kitchen, etc., as if
          looking for something lost, and calling out, <span class=

          date of the annual expulsion of devils is fixed with reference to
          the agricultural seasons. Among the Hos of North-Eastern India the
          great festival of the year is the harvest home, held in January,
          when the granaries are full of grain, and the people, to use their
          own expression, are full of devilry. <span class="tei tei-q">“They
          have a strange notion that at this period men and women are so

          necessary for the safety of the person to let off steam by allowing
          for a time full vent to the passions.”</span> The ceremonies open
          with a sacrifice to the village god of three fowls, two of which
          must be black. Along with them are offered flowers of the Palás
          tree, bread made from rice-flour, and sesamum seeds. These
          offerings are presented by the village priest, who prays that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name=
          "Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> during the year
          about to begin they and their children may be preserved from all
          misfortune and sickness, and that they may have seasonable rain and
          good crops. Prayer is also made in some places for the souls of the
          dead. At this time an evil spirit is supposed to infest the place,
          and to get rid of it men, women, and children go in procession
          round and through every part of the village with sticks in their
          hands, as if beating for game, singing a wild chant, and shouting
          vociferously, till they feel assured that the evil spirit must have
          fled. Then they give themselves up to feasting and drinking
          rice-beer, till they are in a fit state for the wild debauch which
          follows. The festival now <span class="tei tei-q">“becomes a
          saturnale, during which servants forget their duty to their
          masters, children their reverence for parents, men their respect
          for women, and women all notions of modesty, delicacy, and
          gentleness; they become raging bacchantes.”</span> Usually the Hos
          are quiet and reserved in manner, decorous and gentle to women. But
          during this festival <span class="tei tei-q">“their nature appears
          to undergo a temporary change. Sons and daughters revile their
          parents in gross language, and parents their children; men and
          women become almost like animals in the indulgence of their amorous
          propensities.”</span> The Mundaris, kinsmen and neighbours of the
          Hos, keep the festival in much the same manner. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The resemblance to a Saturnale is very complete, as at
          this festival the farm labourers are feasted by their masters, and
          allowed the utmost freedom of speech in addressing them. It is the
          festival of the harvest home; the termination of one year's toil,
          and a slight respite from it before they commence
          again.”</span><a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amongst some of
          the Hindoo Koosh tribes, as among the Hos and Mundaris, the
          expulsion of devils takes place after harvest. When the last crop
          of autumn has been got in, it is thought necessary to drive away
          evil spirits from the granaries. A kind of porridge called
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mool</span></span> is eaten, and the head of
          the family takes his matchlock and fires it into the floor. Then,
          going outside, he sets to work loading and firing till his powder
          horn is exhausted, while all his neighbours are similarly employed.
          The next day is spent in rejoicings. In Chitral this festival is
          called <span class="tei tei-q">“devil-driving.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href="#note_495"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a> On
          the other hand the Khonds of India expel the devils at seed-time
          instead of at harvest. At this time they worship Pitteri Pennu, the
          god of increase and of gain in every shape. On the first day of the
          festival a rude car is made of a basket set upon a few sticks, tied
          upon bamboo rollers for wheels. The priest takes this car first to
          the house of the lineal head of the tribe, to whom precedence is
          given in all ceremonies connected with agriculture. Here he
          receives a little of each kind of seed and some feathers. He then
          takes the car to all the other houses in the village, each of which
          contributes the same things. Lastly, the car is conducted to a
          field without the village, attended by all the young men, who beat
          each other and strike the air violently with long sticks. The seed
          thus carried out is called the share of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“evil spirits, spoilers of the seed.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“These are considered to be driven out with
          the car; and when it and its contents are abandoned to them, they
          are held to have no excuse for interfering with the rest of the
          seed-corn.”</span> Next day each household kills a hog over the
          seed for the year, and prays to Pitteri Pennu. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The elders then feast upon the hogs.
          The young men are excluded from the repast, but enjoy the privilege
          of waylaying and pelting with jungle fruit their elders as they
          return from the feast. Upon the third day the lineal head of the
          tribe goes out and sows his seed, after which all the rest may do
          so.<a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people of
          Bali, an island to the east of Java, have periodical expulsions of
          devils upon a great scale. Generally the time chosen for the
          expulsion is the day of the <span class="tei tei-q">“dark
          moon”</span> in the ninth month. When the demons have been long
          unmolested the country is said to be <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“warm,”</span> and the priest issues orders to expel
          them by force, lest the whole of Bali should be rendered
          uninhabitable. On the day appointed the people of the village or
          district assemble at the principal temple. Here at a cross-road
          offerings are set out for the devils. After prayers have been
          recited by the priests, the blast of a horn summons the devils to
          partake of the meal which has been prepared for them. At the same
          time a number of men step forward and light their torches at the
          holy lamp which burns before the chief priest. Immediately
          afterwards, followed by the bystanders, they spread in all
          directions and march through the streets and lanes crying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Depart! go away!”</span> Wherever they
          pass, the people who have stayed at home hasten by a deafening
          knocking on doors, beams, rice-blocks, etc., to take their share in
          the expulsion of devils. Thus chased from the houses, the fiends
          flee to the banquet which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg
          175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          has been set out for them; but here the priest receives them with
          curses which finally drive them from the district. When the last
          devil has taken his departure, the uproar is succeeded by a dead
          silence, which lasts during the next day also. The devils, it is
          thought, are anxious to return to their old homes, and in order to
          make them think that Bali is not Bali but some desert island, no
          one may stir from his own premises for twenty-four hours. Even
          ordinary household work, including cooking, is discontinued. Only
          the watchmen may show themselves in the streets. Wreaths of thorns
          and leaves are hung at all the entrances to warn strangers from
          entering. Not till the third day is this state of siege raised, and
          even then it is forbidden to work at the rice-fields or to buy and
          sell in the market. Most people still stay at home, striving to
          while away the time with cards and dice.<a id="noteref_497" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some parts of
          Fiji an annual ceremony took place which has much the aspect of an
          expulsion of devils. The time of its celebration was determined by
          the appearance of a certain fish or sea-slug (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">balolo</span></span>) which swarms out in
          dense shoals from the coral reefs on a single day of the year,
          usually in the last quarter of the moon in November. The appearance
          of the sea-slugs was the signal for a general feast at those places
          where they were taken. An influential man ascended a tree and
          prayed to the spirit of the sky for good crops, fair winds, and so
          on. Thereupon a tremendous clatter, with drumming and shouting, was
          raised by all the people in their houses for about half an hour.
          This was followed by a dead quiet for four days, during
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name=
          "Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which the people
          feasted on the sea-slug. All this time no work of any kind might be
          done, not even a leaf plucked nor the offal removed from the
          houses. If a noise was made in any house, as by a child crying, a
          forfeit was at once exacted by the chief. At daylight on the expiry
          of the fourth night the whole town was in an uproar; men and boys
          scampered about, knocking with clubs and sticks at the doors of the
          houses and crying <span class="tei tei-q">“Sinariba.”</span> This
          concluded the ceremony.<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href=

          before spring begins the Japanese throw roasted beans against the
          walls and floors of their houses, crying thrice loudly,

          takes all the sweepings and rubbish of the family and throws them
          out, with the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let all dirt and

          everything and commit horrible violence. To prevent which their
          superstition has suggested to them the institution of this
          theckydaw as a proper means to drive the devil away, and purge the
          country of evil spirits.”</span> The day appointed for the ceremony
          was generally the 25th of February, one month after the
          commencement of the new year, which began on the 25th of January.
          The intermediate month was a season of feasting, merry-making of
          all kinds, and general licence. During the whole month the great
          seal was kept shut up in a box, face downwards, and the law was, as
          it were, laid asleep. All courts of justice were closed; debtors
          could not be seized; small crimes, such as petty larceny, fighting,
          and assault, escaped with impunity; only treason and murder were
          taken account of and the malefactors detained till the great seal
          should come into operation again. At the close of the saturnalia
          the wicked spirits were driven away. Great masses of troops and
          artillery having been drawn up with flying colours and all the pomp
          of war, <span class="tei tei-q">“the general beginneth then to
          offer meat offerings to the criminal devils and malevolent spirits

          when presently he accuses them in a strange language, by characters
          and figures, etc., of many offences and crimes committed by them,
          as to their having disquieted the land, killed his elephants and
          horses, etc., for all which they justly deserved to be chastised
          and banished the country. Whereupon three great guns are fired as
          the last signal; upon which all the artillery and musquets are
          discharged, that, by their most terrible noise the devils may be
          driven away; and they are so blind as to believe <span class=

          expulsion of evil spirits took place in March. Bits of broken
          statues and stones, considered as the abode of the demons, were
          collected and brought to the capital. Here as many elephants were
          collected as could be got together. On the evening of the full moon
          volleys of musketry were fired and the elephants charged furiously
          to put the devils to flight.<a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502"

          palace; it is answered from the next station, and so on from
          station to station, till the firing has reached the outer gate of
          the city. Thus the demons are driven out step by step. As soon as
          this is done a consecrated rope is fastened round the circuit of
          the city walls to prevent the banished demons from returning. The
          rope is made of tough couch-grass and is painted in alternate
          stripes of red, yellow, and blue.<a id="noteref_503" name=

          ceremony was witnessed by the English Mission under Colonel Sladen
          on the 13th of August 1868. Bullocks and cows were slaughtered in
          the market-place; the meat was all sold, part of it was cooked and
          eaten, while the rest was fired out of guns <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> at sundown. The pieces of flesh which
          fell on the land were supposed to become mosquitoes, those which
          fell in the water were believed to turn into leeches. In the
          evening the chief's retainers beat gongs and blew trumpets; and
          when darkness had set in torches were lit and a party, preceded by
          the musicians, searched the central court for the fire-spirit, who
          is supposed to lurk about at this season with evil intent. They
          then searched all the rooms and the gardens, throwing the light of
          the torches into every nook and corner where the evil spirit might
          find a hiding-place.<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Annual
          expulsions of demons or of evil influences are not unknown in
          Europe at the present day. Amongst the heathen Wotyaks, a Finnish
          people of Eastern Russia, all the young girls of the village
          assemble on the last day of the year or on New Year's Day armed
          with sticks, the ends of which are split in nine places. With these
          they beat every corner of the house and yard, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We are driving Satan out of the village.”</span>
          Afterwards the sticks are thrown into the river below the village,
          and as they float down stream Satan goes with them to the next
          village, from which he must be driven out in turn. In some villages
          the expulsion is managed otherwise. The unmarried men receive from
          every house in the village groats, flesh, and brandy. These they
          take to the field, light a fire under a fir-tree, boil the groats,
          and eat of the food they have brought with them, after pronouncing
          the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go away into the wilderness,
          come not into the house.”</span> Then they return to the village
          and enter every house where there are young women. They take hold
          of the young women and throw them into the snow, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“May the spirits of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> disease leave you.”</span> The remains
          of the groats and the other food are then distributed among all the
          houses in proportion to the amount that each contributed, and each
          family consumes its share. According to a Wotyak of the Malmyz
          district the young men throw into the snow whomever they find in
          the houses, and this is called <span class="tei tei-q">“driving out
          Satan;”</span> moreover some of the boiled groats are thrown into
          the fire with the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“O god, afflict us
          not with sickness and pestilence, give us not up as a prey to the
          spirits of the wood.”</span> But the most antique form of the
          ceremony is that observed by the Wotyaks of the Kasan Government.
          First of all a sacrifice is offered to the Devil at noon. Then all
          the men assemble on horseback in the centre of the village, and
          decide with which house they shall begin. When this question, which
          often gives rise to hot disputes, is settled, they tether their
          horses to the paling, and arm themselves with whips, clubs of
          lime-wood, and bundles of lighted twigs. The lighted twigs are
          believed to have the greatest terrors for Satan. Thus armed, they
          proceed with frightful cries to beat every corner of the house and
          yard, then shut the door, and spit at the ejected fiend. So they go
          from house to house, till the Devil has been driven from every one.
          Then they mount their horses and ride out of the village, yelling
          wildly and brandishing their clubs in every direction. Outside of
          the village they fling away the clubs and spit once more at the
          Devil.<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href=

          crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“March is come.”</span> They say

          the Tyrol the expulsion of witches takes place on the first of May.
          On a Thursday at midnight bundles are made up of resinous
          splinters, black and red spotted hemlock, caper-spurge, rosemary,
          and twigs of the sloe. These are kept and burned on May Day by men
          who must first have received plenary absolution from the church. On
          the last three days of April all the houses are cleansed and
          fumigated with juniper berries and rue. On May Day, when the
          evening bell has rung and the twilight is falling, the ceremony of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“burning out the witches,”</span> as it is
          called, begins. Men and boys make a racket with whips, bells, pots,
          and pans; the women carry censers; the dogs are unchained and run
          barking and yelping about. As soon as the church bells begin to
          ring, the bundles of twigs, fastened on poles, are set on fire and
          the incense <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg

          is ignited. Then all the house-bells and dinner-bells are rung,
          pots and pans are clashed, dogs bark, every one must make a noise.
          And amid this hubbub all scream at the pitch of their voices,</p>

          examples cited have belonged to the class of direct or immediate
          expulsion of ills. It remains to illustrate the second class of
          expulsions, in which the evil influences are either embodied in a
          visible form or are at least supposed to be loaded upon a material
          medium, which acts as a vehicle to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          town. The Pomos of California celebrate an expulsion of devils
          every seven years, at which the devils are represented by disguised
          men. <span class="tei tei-q">“Twenty or thirty men array themselves
          in harlequin rig and barbaric paint, and put vessels of pitch on
          their heads; then they secretly go out into the surrounding
          mountains. These are to personify the devils. A herald goes up to
          the top of the assembly-house, and makes a speech to the multitude.
          At a signal agreed upon in the evening the masqueraders come in
          from the mountains, with the vessels of pitch flaming on their
          heads, and with all the frightful accessories of noise, motion, and
          costume which the savage mind can devise in representation of
          demons. The terrified women and children flee for life, the men
          huddle them inside a circle, and, on the principle of fighting the
          devil with fire, they swing blazing firebrands in the air, yell,
          whoop, and make frantic dashes at the marauding and bloodthirsty
          devils, so creating a terrific spectacle, and striking great fear
          into the hearts of the assembled hundreds of women, who are
          screaming and fainting and clinging to their valorous protectors.
          Finally the devils succeed in getting into the assembly-house, and
          the bravest of the men enter and hold a parley with them. As a
          conclusion of the whole farce, the men summon courage, the devils
          are expelled from the assembly-house, and with a prodigious row and
          racket of sham fighting are chased away into the

          devil. A man, painted black to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the prairie, chased and frightened the women, and acted the part of
          a buffalo bull in the buffalo dance, the object of which was to
          ensure a plentiful supply of buffaloes during the ensuing year.
          Finally he was chased from the village, the women pursuing him with
          hisses and gibes, beating him with sticks, and pelting him with
          dirt.<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href=

          consecrated thread of cotton is stretched round the palace to keep
          them out.<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href=

          Kasyas, a hill tribe of Assam, annually expel the demons. The
          ceremony takes place on a fixed month in the year, and part of it
          consists in a struggle between two bands of men who stand on
          opposite sides of a stream, each side tugging at the end of a rope
          which is stretched across the water. In this contest, which
          resembles the game of <span class="tei tei-q">“French and
          English,”</span> the men on one side probably represent the
          demons.<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href=

          on one day of the year, boys are stripped naked and smeared with
          glue in which feathers are stuck. Thus disguised, they run from

          houses against them.<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href=

          ceremony is probably a relic of an annual expulsion of devils.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oftener,
          however, the expelled demons are not represented at all, but are
          understood to be present invisibly in the material and visible
          vehicle which conveys them away. Here, again, it will be convenient
          to distinguish between occasional and periodical expulsions. We
          begin with the former.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vehicle
          which conveys away the demons may be of various kinds. A common one
          is a little ship or boat. Thus, in the southern district of the
          island of Ceram, when a whole village suffers from sickness, a
          small ship is made and filled with rice, tobacco, eggs, etc., which
          have been contributed by all the people. A little sail is hoisted
          on the ship. When all is ready, a man calls out in a very loud
          voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“O all ye sicknesses, ye
          small-poxes, agues, measles, etc., who have visited us so long and
          wasted us so sorely, but who now cease to plague us, we have made
          ready this ship for you, and we have furnished you with provender
          sufficient for the voyage. Ye shall have no lack of food nor of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">siri</span></span> nor of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pinang</span></span> nor of tobacco. Depart,
          and sail away from us directly; never come near us again, but go to
          a land which is far from here. Let all the tides and winds
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name=
          "Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> waft you speedily
          thither, and so convey you thither that for the time to come we may
          live sound and well, and that we may never see the sun rise on you
          again.”</span> Then ten or twelve men carry the vessel to the
          shore, and let it drift away with the land-breeze, feeling
          convinced that they are free from sickness for ever, or at least
          till the next time. If sickness attacks them again, they are sure
          it is not the same sickness, but a different one, which in due time
          they dismiss in the same manner. When the demon-laden bark is lost
          to sight, the bearers return to the village, whereupon a man cries
          out, <span class="tei tei-q">“The sicknesses are now gone,
          vanished, expelled, and sailed away.”</span> At this all the people
          come running out of their houses, passing the word from one to the
          other with great joy, beating on gongs and on tinkling
          instruments.<a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516" href=
          "#note_516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">516</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similar
          ceremonies are commonly resorted to in other East Indian islands.
          Thus in Timorlaut, to mislead the demons who are causing sickness,
          a small prao, containing the image of a man and provisioned for a
          long voyage, is allowed to drift away with wind and tide. As it is
          being launched, the people cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“O
          sickness, go from here; turn back; what do you here in this poor
          land?”</span> Three days after this ceremony a pig is killed, and
          part of the flesh is offered to Dudilaa, who lives in the sun. One
          of the oldest men says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Old sir, I beseech
          you, make well the grandchildren, children, women, and men, that we
          may be able to eat pork and rice and to drink palm-wine. I will
          keep my promise. Eat your share, and make all the people in the
          village well.”</span> If the prao is stranded at any inhabited
          spot, the sickness will break <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> out there. Hence a stranded prao excites much
          alarm amongst the coast population, and they immediately burn it,
          because demons fly from fire.<a id="noteref_517" name="noteref_517"
          href="#note_517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">517</span></span></a> In
          the island of Buro the prao which carries away the demons of
          disease is about twenty feet long, rigged out with sails, oars,
          anchor, etc., and well stocked with provisions. For a day and a
          night the people beat gongs and drums, and rush about to frighten
          the demons. Next morning ten stalwart young men strike the people
          with branches, which have been previously dipped in an earthen pot
          of water. As soon as they have done so, they run down to the beach,
          put the branches on board the prao, launch another prao in great
          haste, and tow the disease-burdened prao far out to sea. There they
          cast it off, and one of them calls out, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Grandfather Small-pox, go away—go willingly away—go
          visit another land; we have made you food ready for the voyage, we
          have now nothing more to give.”</span> When they have landed, all
          the people bathe together in the sea.<a id="noteref_518" name=
          "noteref_518" href="#note_518"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a> In
          this ceremony the reason for striking the people with the branches
          is clearly to rid them of the disease-demons, which are then
          supposed to be transferred to the branches. Hence the haste with
          which the branches are deposited in the prao and towed away to sea.
          So in the inland districts of Ceram, when small-pox or other
          sickness is raging, the priest strikes all the houses with
          consecrated branches, which are then thrown into the river, to be
          carried down to the sea;<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519"
          href="#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a>
          exactly as amongst the Wotyaks of Russia the sticks which have been
          used for expelling the devils from the village are <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thrown into the river, that the current
          may sweep the baleful burden away. In Amboina, for a similar
          purpose, the whole body of the patient is rubbed with a live white
          cock, which is then placed on a little prao and committed to the
          waves;<a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href=
          "#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a> and
          in the Babar archipelago the bark which is to carry away to sea the
          sickness of a whole village contains a bowl of ashes taken from
          every kitchen in the village, and another bowl into which all the
          sick people have spat.<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href=
          "#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> The
          plan of putting puppets in the boat to represent sick persons, in
          order to lure the demons after them, is not uncommon.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The practice of
          sending away diseases in boats is known outside the limits of the
          East Indian Archipelago. Thus when the people of Tikopia, a small
          island in the Pacific, to the north of the New Hebrides, were
          attacked by an epidemic cough, they made a little canoe and adorned
          it with flowers. Four sons of the principal chiefs carried it on
          their shoulders all round the island, accompanied by the whole
          population, some of whom beat the bushes, while others uttered loud
          cries. On returning to the spot from which they had set out, they
          launched the canoe on the sea.<a id="noteref_523" name=
          "noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class=

          the Nicobar Islands, in the Bay of Bengal, when there is much
          sickness in a village or no fish are caught, the blame is laid upon
          the spirits. They <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg
          189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          must be propitiated with offerings. All relations and friends are
          invited, a huge pig is roasted, and the best of it is eaten, but
          some parts are offered to the shades. The heap of offerings remains
          in front of the house till it is carried away by the rising tide.
          Then the priests, their faces reddened with paint and swine's

          vehicle which carries away the collected demons or ills of a whole
          community is an animal or scapegoat. In the Central Provinces of
          India, when cholera breaks out in a village, every one retires
          after sunset to his house. The priests then parade the streets,
          taking from the roof of each house a straw, which is burnt with an
          offering of rice, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ghi</span></span>, and turmeric, at some
          shrine to the east of the village. Chickens daubed with vermilion
          are driven away in the direction of the smoke, and are believed to
          carry the disease with them. If they fail, goats are tried, and
          last of all pigs.<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href=

          cholera is very bad among the Bhárs, Malláns, and Kurmís of India,
          they take a goat or a buffalo—in either case the animal must be a
          female, and as black as possible—then they tie some grain, cloves,
          and red lead in a yellow cloth on its back, and turn it out of the
          village. It is conducted beyond the boundary, and is not allowed to
          return.<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href=

          influenza, <span class="tei tei-q">“I had an application from the
          old Queen Dowager of Sagar to allow of a noisy religious
          procession, for the purpose of imploring deliverance from this
          great calamity. Men, women, and children in this procession were to
          do their utmost to add to the noise by 'raising their voices in
          psalmody,' beating upon their brass pots and pans with all their
          might, and discharging firearms where they could get them. Before
          the noisy crowd was to be driven a buffalo, which had been
          purchased by general subscription, in order that every family might
          participate in the merit. They were to follow it out eight miles,
          where it was to be turned loose for any man who would take it. If
          the animal returned the disease must return with it, and the
          ceremony be performed over again.... It was, however, subsequently
          determined that the animal should be a goat; and he was driven
          before the crowd accordingly. I have on several occasions been
          requested to allow of such noisy ceremonies in cases of
          epidemics.”</span><a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href=

          when influenza was raging in Pithuria, a man had a small carriage
          made, after a plan of his own, for a pair of scapegoats, which were
          harnessed to it and driven to a wood at some distance, where they
          were let loose. From that hour the disease entirely ceased in the
          town. The goats never returned; had they done so, <span class=

          idea of the scapegoat is not uncommon in the hills of the Eastern
          Ghats. In 1886, during a severe outbreak of small-pox, the people
          of Jeypur made <span class="tei tei-q">“puja”</span> to a goat,
          marched it to the Ghats, and let it loose on <span class=

          Southern Konkan, on the appearance of cholera, the villagers went
          in procession from the temple to the extreme boundaries of the
          village, carrying a basket of cooked rice covered with red powder,
          a wooden doll representing the pestilence, and a cock. The head of
          the cock was cut off at the village boundary, and the body was
          thrown away. When cholera was thus transferred from one village to
          another, the second village observed the same ceremony and passed
          on the scourge to its neighbours, and so on through a number of
          villages.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href=

          the Aymara Indians were suffering from a plague, they loaded a

          Sometimes the scapegoat is a man. Some of the aboriginal tribes of
          China, as a protection against pestilence, select a man of great
          muscular strength to act the part of scapegoat. Having besmeared
          his face with paint, he performs many antics with the view of
          enticing all pestilential and noxious influences to attach
          themselves to him only. He is assisted by a priest. Finally the
          scapegoat, hotly pursued by men and women beating gongs and
          tom-toms, is driven with great haste out of the town or
          village.<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href=

          Hindu cure for the murrain is to hire a man of the Chamár caste,

          vehicle, like the immediate expulsion of them in invisible form,
          tends to become periodic, and for a like reason. Thus every year,
          generally in March, the people of Leti, Moa, and Lakor send away
          all their diseases to sea. They make a prao about six feet long,
          rig it with sails, oars, rudder, etc., and every family deposits in
          it some rice, fruit, a fowl, two eggs, insects that ravage the

          Amongst many of the aboriginal tribes of China, a great festival is
          celebrated in the third month of every year. It is held by way of a
          general rejoicing over what the people believe to be a total
          annihilation of the ills of the past twelve months. This
          annihilation is supposed to be effected in the following way. A
          large earthenware jar filled with gunpowder, stones, and bits of
          iron is buried in the earth. A train of gunpowder, communicating
          with the jar, is then laid; and a match being applied, the jar and
          its contents are blown up. The stones and bits of iron represent
          the ills and disasters of the past year, and the dispersion of them
          by the explosion is believed to remove the ills and disasters
          themselves. The festival is attended with much revelling and
          drunkenness.<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href=

          represent human beings, others birds, crocodiles, and so on. After
          three or four weeks the devils are expected to take up their abode
          in these figures. When the night comes for their general expulsion,
          the people feast and sally out in parties, beating at empty
          corners, and shouting with all their might. Shots are fired, the

          white dogs, decorated with red paint, wampum, feathers, and ribbons
          were led out. They were soon strangled, and hung on a ladder.

          the people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Tibet the
          ceremony of the scapegoat is marked by some peculiar features. The
          Tibetan New Year begins with the new moon, which appears about 15th
          February. For twenty-three days afterwards the government of Lhásá,
          the capital, is taken out of the hands of the ordinary rulers and
          entrusted to the monk of the Debang monastery who offers to pay the
          highest sum for the privilege. The successful bidder is called the
          Jalno, and he announces the fact in person through the streets of
          Lhásá, bearing a silver stick. Monks from all the neighbouring
          monasteries and temples assemble to pay him homage. The Jalno
          exercises his authority in the most arbitrary manner for his own
          benefit, as all the fines which he exacts are his by purchase. The
          profit he makes is about ten times the amount of the purchase
          money. His men go about the streets in order to discover any
          conduct on the part of the inhabitants that can be found fault
          with. Every house in Lhásá is taxed at this time, and the slightest
          fault is punished with unsparing rigour by fines. This severity of
          the Jalno drives all working classes out of the city till the
          twenty-three days are over. Meantime, all the priests flock from
          the neighbourhood to the Máchindránáth temple, where they perform
          religious ceremonies. The temple is a very large one, standing in
          the centre of the city, surrounded by bazaars and shops. The idols
          in it are richly inlaid with gold and precious stones. Twenty-four
          days <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name=
          "Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> after the Jalno has
          ceased to have authority, he assumes it again, and for ten days
          acts in the same arbitrary manner as before. On the first of the
          ten days the priests assemble as before at the Máchindránáth
          temple, pray to the gods to prevent sickness and other evils among
          the people, <span class="tei tei-q">“and, as a peace-offering,
          sacrifice one man. The man is not killed purposely, but the
          ceremony he undergoes often proves fatal.<a id="noteref_550" name=

          is thrown against his head, and his face is painted half white,
          half black.”</span> On the tenth day, all the troops in Lhásá march
          to the temple and form in line before it. The victim is brought
          forth from the temple and receives small donations from the
          assembled multitude. He then throws dice with the Jalno. If the
          victim wins, much evil is foreboded; but if the Jalno wins, there
          is great rejoicing, for it is then believed that the victim has
          been accepted by the gods to bear all the sins of the people of
          Lhásá. Thereupon his face is painted half white and half black, a
          leathern coat is put on him, and he is marched to the walls of the
          city, followed by the whole populace, hooting, shouting, and firing
          volleys after him. When he is driven outside the city, the people
          return, and the victim is carried to the Sáme monastery. Should he
          die shortly afterwards, the people say it is an auspicious sign;
          but if not, he is kept a prisoner at the monastery for a whole
          year, after which he is allowed to return to Lhásá.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Human
          scapegoats, as we shall see presently, were <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> well known in classical antiquity, and
          even in mediæval Europe the custom seems not to have been wholly
          extinct. In the town of Halberstadt in Thüringen there was a church
          which was said to have been founded by Charlemagne. In this church
          every year a man was chosen, who was believed to be stained with
          heinous sins. On the first day of Lent he was brought to the
          church, dressed in mourning garb, with his head muffled up. At the
          close of the service he was turned out of the church. During the
          forty days of Lent he perambulated the city barefoot, neither
          entering the churches nor speaking to any one. The canons took it
          in turn to feed him. After midnight he was allowed to sleep on the
          streets. On the day before Good Friday, after the consecration of
          the holy oil, he was readmitted to the church and absolved from his
          sins. The people gave him money. He was called Adam, and was now
          believed to be in a state of innocence.<a id="noteref_552" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> At
          Entlebuch in Switzerland, down to the close of last century, the
          custom of annually expelling a scapegoat was preserved in the
          ceremony of driving <span class="tei tei-q">“Posterli”</span> from
          the village into the lands of the neighbouring village.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Posterli”</span> was represented by a lad
          disguised as an old witch or as a goat or an ass. Amid a deafening
          noise of horns, clarionets, bells, whips, etc. he was driven out.
          Sometimes <span class="tei tei-q">“Posterli”</span> was represented
          by a puppet, which was drawn in a sledge and left in a corner of
          the neighbouring village. The ceremony took place on the Thursday
          evening of the last week but one before Christmas.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
          scapegoat is a divine animal. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> people of Malabar share the Hindu reverence
          for the cow, to kill and eat which <span class="tei tei-q">“they
          esteem to be a crime as heinous as homicide or wilful
          murder.”</span> Nevertheless <span class="tei tei-q">“the Bramans
          transfer the sins of the people into one or more Cows, which are
          then carry'd away, both the Cows and the Sins wherewith these
          Beasts are charged, to what place the Braman shall
          appoint.”</span><a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href=
          "#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a> When
          the ancient Egyptians sacrificed a bull, they invoked upon its head
          all the evils that might otherwise befall themselves and the land
          of Egypt, and thereupon they either sold the bull's head to the
          Greeks or cast it into the river.<a id="noteref_555" name=
          "noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> Now,
          it cannot be said that in the times known to us the Egyptians
          worshipped bulls in general, for they seem to have commonly killed
          and eaten them.<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href=
          "#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a> But a
          good many circumstances point to the conclusion that originally all
          cattle, bulls as well as cows, were held sacred by the Egyptians.
          For not only were all cows esteemed holy by them and never
          sacrificed, but even bulls might not be sacrificed unless they had
          certain natural marks; a priest examined every bull before it was
          sacrificed; if it had the proper marks, he put his seal on the
          animal in token that it might be sacrificed; and if a man
          sacrificed a bull which had not been sealed, he was put to death.
          Moreover, the worship of the black bulls Apis and Mnevis,
          especially the former, played an important part in Egyptian
          religion; all bulls that died a natural death were carefully buried
          in the suburbs of the cities, and their bones were afterwards
          collected from all parts of Egypt and buried in a single spot; and
          at the sacrifice of a bull in the great <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> rites of Isis all the worshippers beat their
          breasts and mourned.<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href=
          "#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a> On
          the whole, then, we are perhaps entitled to infer that bulls were
          originally, as cows were always, esteemed sacred by the Egyptians,
          and that the slain bull upon whose head they laid the misfortunes
          of the people was once a divine scapegoat. It seems not improbable
          that the lamb annually slain by the Madis of Central Africa is a
          divine scapegoat, and the same supposition may partly explain the
          Zuni sacrifice of the turtle.<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558"
          href="#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, the
          scapegoat may be a divine man. Thus, in November the Gonds of India
          worship Ghansyam Deo, the protector of the crops, and at the
          festival the god himself is said to descend on the head of one of
          the worshippers, who is suddenly seized with a kind of fit and,
          after staggering about, rushes off into the jungle, where it is
          believed that, if left to himself, he would die mad. As it is, he
          is brought back, but does not recover his senses for one or two
          days. <span class="tei tei-q">“The idea is, that one man is thus
          singled out as a scapegoat for the sins of the rest of the
          village.”</span><a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href=
          "#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a> In
          the temple of the Moon the Albanians of the Eastern Caucasus kept a
          number of sacred slaves, of whom many were inspired and prophesied.
          When one of these men exhibited more than usual symptoms of
          inspiration and wandered solitary up and down the woods, like the
          Gond in the jungle, the high priest had him bound with a sacred
          chain and maintained him in luxury for a year. At the end of the
          year he was anointed with unguents and led forth to be sacrificed.
          A man whose business it was to slay these human victims and to whom
          practice had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg
          202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          given dexterity, advanced from the crowd and thrust a sacred spear
          into the victim's side, piercing his heart. From the manner in
          which the slain man fell, omens were drawn as to the welfare of the
          commonwealth. Then the body was carried to a certain spot where all
          the people stood upon it as a purificatory ceremony.<a id=
          "noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> This
          last circumstance clearly indicates that the sins of the people
          were transferred to the victim, just as the Jewish priest
          transferred the sins of the people to the scapegoat by laying his
          hand on the animal's head; and since the man was believed to be
          possessed by the divine spirit, we have here an undoubted example
          of a man-god slain to take away the sins and misfortunes of the
          people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
          survey of the custom of publicly expelling the accumulated evils of
          a village or district suggests a few general observations. In the
          first place, it will not be disputed that what I have called the
          immediate and the mediate expulsions of evil are identical in
          intention; in other words, that whether the evils are conceived of
          as invisible or as embodied in a material form, is a circumstance
          entirely subordinate to the main object of the ceremony, which is
          simply to effect a total clearance of all the ills that have been
          infesting a people. If any link were wanting to connect the two
          kinds of expulsion, it would be furnished by such a practice as
          that of sending the evils away in a boat. For here, on the one
          hand, the evils are invisible and intangible; and, on the other
          hand, there is a visible and tangible vehicle to convey them away.
          And a scapegoat is nothing more than such a
          vehicle.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg
          203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the second
          place, when a general clearance of evils is resorted to
          periodically, the interval between the celebrations of the ceremony
          is commonly a year, and the time of year when the ceremony takes
          place usually coincides with some well-marked change of season—such
          as the close of winter in the arctic and temperate zones, and the
          beginning or end of the rainy season in the tropics. The increased
          mortality which such climatic changes are apt to produce,
          especially amongst ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed savages, is
          set down by primitive man to the agency of demons, who must
          accordingly be expelled. Hence, in New Britain and Peru, the devils
          are or were driven out at the beginning of the rainy season. When a
          tribe has taken to agriculture, the time for the general expulsion
          of devils is naturally made to agree with one of the great epochs
          of the agricultural year, as sowing or harvest; but, as these
          epochs themselves often coincide with changes of season, it does
          not follow that the transition from the hunting or pastoral to the
          agricultural life involves any alteration in the time of
          celebrating this great annual rite. Some of the agricultural
          communities of India and the Hindoo Koosh, as we have seen, hold
          their general clearance of demons at harvest, others at
          sowing-time. But, at whatever season of the year it is held, the
          general expulsion of devils commonly marks the beginning of the new
          year. For, before entering on a new year, people are anxious to rid
          themselves of the troubles that have harassed them in the past;
          hence the fact that amongst so many people—Iroquois, Tonquinese,
          Siamese, Tibetans, etc.—the beginning of the new year is
          inaugurated with a solemn and public banishment of evil
          spirits.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg
          204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the third
          place, it is to be observed that this public and periodic expulsion
          of devils is commonly preceded or followed by a period of general
          licence, during which the ordinary restraints of society are thrown
          aside, and all offences, short of the gravest, are allowed to pass
          unpunished. In Guinea and Tonquin the period of licence precedes
          the public expulsion of demons; and the suspension of the ordinary
          government in Lhásá previous to the expulsion of the scapegoat is
          perhaps a relic of a similar period of universal licence. Amongst
          the Hos the period of licence follows the expulsion of the devil.
          Amongst the Iroquois it hardly appears whether it preceded or
          followed the banishment of evils. In any case, the extraordinary
          relaxation of all ordinary rules of conduct on such occasions is
          doubtless to be explained by the general clearance of evils which
          precedes or follows it. On the one hand, when a general riddance of
          evil and absolution from all sin is in immediate prospect, men are
          encouraged to give the rein to their passions, trusting that the
          coming ceremony will wipe out the score which they are running up
          so fast. On the other hand, when the ceremony has just taken place,
          men's minds are freed from the oppressive sense, under which they
          generally labour, of an atmosphere surcharged with devils; and in
          the first revulsion of joy they overleap the limits commonly
          imposed by custom and morality. When the ceremony takes place at
          harvest-time, the elation of feeling which it excites is further
          stimulated by the state of physical wellbeing produced by an
          abundant supply of food.<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561"
          href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fourthly, the
          employment of a divine man or animal as a scapegoat is especially
          to be noted; indeed, we are here directly concerned with the custom
          of banishing evils only in so far as these evils are believed to be
          transferred to a god who is afterwards slain. It may be suspected
          that the custom of employing a divine man or animal as a public
          scapegoat is much more widely diffused than appears from the
          examples cited. For, as has already been pointed out, the custom of
          killing a god dates from so early a period of human history that in
          later ages, even when the custom continues to be practised, it is
          liable to be misinterpreted. The divine character of the animal or
          man is forgotten, and he comes to be regarded merely as an ordinary
          victim. This is especially likely to be the case when it is a
          divine man who is killed. For when a nation becomes <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> civilised, if it does not drop human
          sacrifices altogether, it at least selects as victims only such
          criminals as would be put to death at any rate. Thus, as in the
          Sacaean festival at Babylon, the killing of a god may come to be
          confounded with the execution of a criminal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we ask why a
          dying god should be selected to take upon himself and carry away
          the sins and sorrows of the people, it may be suggested that in the
          practice of using the divinity as a scapegoat we have a combination
          of two customs which were at one time distinct and independent. On
          the one hand we have seen that it has been customary to kill the
          human or animal god in order to save his divine life from being
          weakened by the inroads of age. On the other hand we have seen that
          it has been customary to have a general expulsion of evils and sins
          once a year. Now, if it occurred to people to combine these two
          customs, the result would be the employment of the dying god as a
          scapegoat. He was killed, not originally to take away sin, but to
          save the divine life from the degeneracy of old age; but, since he
          had to be killed at any rate, people may have thought that they
          might as well seize the opportunity to lay upon him the burden of
          their sufferings and sins, in order that he might bear it away with
          him to the unknown world beyond the grave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The use of the
          divinity as a scapegoat clears up the ambiguity which, as we saw,
          appeared to hang about the European folk-custom of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“carrying out Death.”</span><a id="noteref_562" name=
          "noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a>
          Grounds have been shown for believing that in this ceremony the
          so-called Death was originally the spirit of vegetation, who was
          annually <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg
          207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          slain in spring, in order that he might come to life again with all
          the vigour of youth. But, as we saw, there are certain features in
          the ceremony which are not explicable on this hypothesis alone.
          Such are the marks of joy with which the effigy of Death is carried
          out to be buried or burnt, and the fear and abhorrence of it
          manifested by the bearers. But these features become at once
          intelligible if we suppose that the Death was not merely the dying
          god of vegetation, but also a public scapegoat, upon whom were laid
          all the evils that had afflicted the people during the past year.
          Joy on such an occasion is natural and appropriate; and if the
          dying god appears to be the object of that fear and abhorrence
          which are properly due not to himself, but to the sins and
          misfortunes with which he is laden, this arises merely from the
          difficulty of distinguishing or at least of marking the distinction
          between the bearer and the burden. When the burden is of a baleful
          character, the bearer of it will be feared and shunned just as much
          as if he were himself instinct with those dangerous properties of
          which, as it happens, he is only the vehicle. Similarly we have
          seen that disease-laden and sin-laden boats are dreaded and shunned
          by East Indian peoples.<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href=
          "#note_563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a>
          Again, the view that in these popular customs the Death is a
          scapegoat as well as a representative of the divine spirit of
          vegetation derives some support from the circumstance that its
          expulsion is always celebrated in spring and chiefly by Slavonic
          peoples. For the Slavonic year began in spring;<a id="noteref_564"
          name="noteref_564" href="#note_564"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> and
          thus, in one of its aspects, the ceremony of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“carrying out Death”</span> would be an example of the
          widespread <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg
          208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          custom of expelling the accumulated evils of the past year before
          entering on a new one.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are now
          prepared to notice the use of the scapegoat in classical antiquity.
          Every year on the 14th of March a man clad in skins was led in
          procession through the streets of Rome, beaten with long white
          rods, and driven out of the city. He was called Mamurius
          Veturius,<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href=
          "#note_565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">565</span></span></a> that
          is, <span class="tei tei-q">“the old Mars,”</span><a id=
          "noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href="#note_566"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> and
          as the ceremony took place on the day preceding the first full moon
          of the old Roman year (which began on 1st March), the skin-clad man
          must have represented the Mars of the past year, who was driven out
          at the beginning of a new one. Now Mars was originally not a god of
          war but of vegetation. For it was to Mars that the Roman husbandman
          prayed for the prosperity of his corn and his vines, his
          fruit-trees and his copses;<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567"
          href="#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a> it
          was to Mars that the priestly college of the Arval Brothers, whose
          business it was to sacrifice for the growth of the crops,<a id=
          "noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a>
          addressed their petitions almost exclusively;<a id="noteref_569"
          name="noteref_569" href="#note_569"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a> and
          it was to Mars, as we saw,<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570"
          href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a> that
          a horse was sacrificed in October to secure an abundant harvest.
          Moreover, it was to Mars, under his title of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Mars of the
          woods”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Mars Silvanus</span></span>)
          that farmers offered sacrifice for the welfare of their
          cattle.<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href=
          "#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> We
          have already seen that cattle are commonly supposed to be under the
          special patronage of tree-gods.<a id="noteref_572" name=
          "noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a> Once
          more, the fact that the vernal month of March was dedicated to Mars
          seems to point him out as the deity of the sprouting vegetation.
          Thus the Roman custom of expelling the old Mars at the beginning of
          the New Year in spring is identical with the Slavonic custom of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“carrying out Death,”</span> if the view
          here taken of the latter custom is correct. The similarity of the
          Roman and Slavonic customs has been already remarked by scholars,
          who appear, however, to have taken Mamurius Veturius and the
          corresponding figures in the Slavonic ceremonies to be
          representatives of the old year rather than of the old god of
          vegetation.<a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href=
          "#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a> It is
          possible that ceremonies of this kind may have come to be thus
          interpreted in later times even by the people who practised them.
          But the personification of a period of time is too abstract an idea
          to be primitive. However, in the Roman, as in the Slavonic,
          ceremony, the representative of the god appears to have been
          treated not only as a deity of vegetation but also as a scapegoat.
          His expulsion implies this; for there is no reason why the god of
          vegetation, as such, should be expelled the city. But it is
          otherwise if he is also a scapegoat; it then becomes necessary to
          drive him beyond the boundaries, that he may carry his sorrowful
          burden away to other lands. And, in fact, Mamurius Veturius appears
          to have been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg
          210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          driven away to the land of the Oscans, the enemies of Rome.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ancient
          Greeks were also familiar with the use of a human scapegoat. At
          Plutarch's native town of Chaeronea in Boeotia, there was a
          ceremony of this kind performed by the chief magistrate at the Town
          Hall, and by each householder at his own home. It was called the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“expulsion of hunger.”</span> A slave was
          beaten with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg
          211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          rods of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          and turned out of doors with the words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Out with hunger, and in with wealth and
          health.”</span> When Plutarch held the office of chief magistrate
          of his native town he performed this ceremony at the Town Hall, and
          he has recorded the discussion to which the custom afterwards gave
          rise.<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575</span></span></a> The
          ceremony closely resembles the Japanese, Hindoo, and Highland
          customs already described.<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in civilised
          Greece the custom of the scapegoat took darker forms than the
          innocent rite over which the amiable and pious Plutarch presided.
          Whenever Marseilles, one of the busiest and most brilliant of Greek
          colonies, was ravaged by a plague, a man of the poorer classes used
          to offer himself as a scapegoat. For a whole year he was maintained
          at the public expense, being fed on choice and pure food. At the
          expiry of the year he was dressed in sacred garments, decked with
          holy branches, and led through the whole city, while prayers were
          uttered that all the evils of the people might fall on his head. He
          was then cast out of the city.<a id="noteref_577" name=

          Athenians regularly maintained a number of degraded and useless
          beings at the public expense; and when any calamity, such as
          plague, drought, or famine befell the city, they sacrificed two of
          these outcasts as scapegoats. One of the victims was sacrificed for
          the men and the other for the women. The former wore round his neck
          a string of black, the latter a string of white figs. Sometimes, it
          seems, the victim slain on behalf of the women was a woman. They
          were led about the city and then sacrificed, apparently by being
          stoned to death outside the city.<a id="noteref_578" name=

          such sacrifices were not confined to extraordinary occasions of
          public calamity; it appears that every year, at the festival of the
          Thargelia in May, two victims, one for the men and one for the
          women, were led out of Athens and stoned to death.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the Lover's
          Leap, a white bluff at the southern end of their island, the
          Leucadians used annually to hurl a criminal into the sea as a
          scapegoat. But to lighten his fall they fastened live birds and
          feathers to him, and a flotilla of small boats waited below to
          catch him and convey him beyond the boundary.<a id="noteref_580"

          Doubtless these humane precautions were a mitigation of an earlier
          custom of flinging the scapegoat into the sea to drown. The custom
          of the scapegoat as practised by the Greeks of Asia Minor in the
          sixth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> was as follows. When
          a city suffered from plague, famine, or other public calamity, an
          ugly or deformed person was chosen to take upon himself all the
          evils by which the city was afflicted. He was brought to a suitable
          place where dried figs, a barley loaf, and cheese were put into his
          hand. These he ate. Then he was beaten seven times upon his genital
          organs with squills and branches of the wild fig and other wild
          trees. Afterwards he was burned on a pyre constructed of the wood
          of forest trees; and his ashes were cast into the sea.<a id=

          just described the beating of the victim with squills, branches of
          the wild fig, etc., cannot have been intended to aggravate his
          sufferings, otherwise any stick would have been good enough to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name=
          "Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> beat him with. The

          points out that the ancients attributed to squills a magical power
          of averting evil influences, and accordingly hung them up at the
          doors of their houses and made use of them in purificatory
          rites.<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href=

          the Arcadian custom of beating the image of Pan with squills at a
          festival or whenever the hunters returned empty-handed,<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a> must
          have been meant, not to punish the god, but to purify him from the
          harmful influences which were impeding him in the exercise of his
          divine functions as a god who should supply the hunter with game.
          Similarly the object of beating the human scapegoat on the genital
          organs with squills, etc., must have been to release his
          reproductive energies from any restraint or spell under which they
          might be laid by demoniacal or other malignant agency; and as the
          Thargelia at which he was annually sacrificed was an early harvest
          festival,<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href=
          "#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a> we
          must recognise in him a representative of the creative and
          fertilising god of vegetation. The representative of the god was
          annually slain for the purpose I have indicated, that of
          maintaining the divine life in perpetual vigour, untainted by the
          weakness of age; and before he was put to death it was not
          unnatural to stimulate his reproductive powers in order that these
          might be transmitted in full activity to his successor, the new god
          or new embodiment of the old god, who was doubtless supposed
          immediately to take the place of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class=

          Similar reasoning would lead to a similar treatment of the
          scapegoat on special occasions, such as drought or famine. If the
          crops did not answer to the expectation of the husbandman, this
          would be attributed to some failure in the generative powers of the
          god whose function it was to produce the fruits of the earth. It
          might be thought he was under a spell or was growing old and
          feeble. Accordingly he was slain in the person of his
          representative, with all the ceremonies already described, in order
          that, born young again, he might infuse his own youthful vigour
          into the stagnant energies of nature. On the same principle we can
          understand why Mamurius Veturius was beaten with rods, why the
          slave at the Chaeronean ceremony was beaten with the <span lang=

          the effigy of Death in north Europe is assailed with sticks and
          stones, and why at Babylon the criminal who played the god was
          scourged before he was crucified. The purpose of the scourging was
          not to intensify the agony of the divine sufferer, but on the
          contrary to dispel any malignant influences by which at the supreme
          moment he might conceivably be beset.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          interpretation here given to the custom of beating the human
          scapegoat with certain plants is supported by many analogies. With
          the same intention some of the Brazilian Indians beat themselves on
          the genital organs with an aquatic plant, the white <span class=

          Indians of the Quixos, in South America, before they set out on a
          long hunting expedition, cause their wives to whip them with

          overtake the peccaries. They resort to the same proceeding as a
          cure for sickness.<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the view here
          taken of the Greek scapegoat is correct, it obviates an objection
          which might otherwise be brought against the main argument of this
          chapter. To the theory that the priest of Nemi was slain as a
          representative of the spirit of the grove, it might have been
          objected that such a custom has no analogy in classical antiquity.
          But reasons have now been given for believing that the human being
          periodically and occasionally slain by the Asiatic Greeks was
          regularly treated as an embodiment of a divinity. Probably the
          persons whom the Athenians kept to be sacrificed were similarly
          treated as divine. That they were social outcasts did not matter.
          On the primitive view a man is not chosen to be the mouth-piece or
          embodiment of a god on account of his high moral qualities or
          social standing. The divine afflatus descends equally on the good
          and the bad, the lofty and the lowly. If then the civilised Greeks
          of Asia and Athens habitually sacrificed men whom they regarded as
          incarnate gods, there can be no inherent improbability in the
          supposition that at the dawn of history a similar custom was
          observed by the semi-barbarous Latins in the Arician Grove.</p>

          Mexico.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the religion
          of ancient Mexico, as it was found and described by the Spanish
          conquerors in the sixteenth century, offers perhaps the closest
          parallels to the rule of the Arician priesthood, as I conceive that
          rule to have been originally observed. Certainly nowhere does the
          custom of killing the human representative of a god appear to have
          been carried out so systematically and on so extensive a scale as
          in Mexico. <span class="tei tei-q">“They tooke a captive,”</span>
          says Acosta, <span class="tei tei-q">“such as they thought good;
          and afore they did sacrifice him unto their idolls, they gave him
          the name of the idoll, to whom hee should be sacrificed, and
          apparelled him with the same ornaments like their idoll, saying
          that he did represent the same idoll. And during the time that this
          representation lasted, which was for a yeere in some feasts, in
          others six moneths, and in others lesse, they reverenced and
          worshipped him in the same maner as the proper idoll; and in the
          meane time he did eate, drincke, and was merry. When hee went
          through the streetes the people came forth to worship him, and
          every one brought him an almes, with children and sicke folkes,
          that he might cure them, and bless them, suffering him to doe all
          things at his pleasure, onely hee was accompanied with tenne or
          twelve men lest he should flie. And he (to the end he might be
          reverenced as he passed) sometimes sounded upon a small flute, that
          the people might prepare to worship him. The feast being come, and
          hee growne fatte, they killed him, opened him, and eat him, making
          a solempne sacrifice <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg

          example, at the annual festival of the great god Tezcatlipoca,
          which fell about Easter or a few days later, a young man was chosen
          to be the living image of Tezcatlipoca for a whole year. He had to
          be of unblemished body, and he was carefully trained to sustain his
          lofty role with becoming grace and dignity. During the year he was
          lapped in luxury, and the king himself took care that the future
          victim was apparelled in gorgeous attire, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“for already he esteemed him as a god.”</span> Attended
          by eight pages clad in the royal livery, the young man roamed the
          streets of the capital day and night at his pleasure, carrying
          flowers and playing the flute. All who saw him fell on their knees
          before him and adored him, and he graciously acknowledged their
          homage. Twenty days before the festival at which he was to be
          sacrificed, four damsels, delicately nurtured, and bearing the
          names of four goddesses, were given him to be his brides. For five
          days before the sacrifice divine honours were showered on him more
          abundantly than ever. The king remained in his palace, while the
          whole court went after the destined victim. Everywhere there were
          solemn banquets and balls. On the last day the young man, still
          attended by his pages, was ferried across the lake in a covered
          barge to a small and lonely temple, which, like the Mexican temples
          in general, rose in the form of a pyramid. As he ascended the
          stairs of the temple he broke at every step one of the flutes on
          which he had played in the days of his glory. On reaching the
          summit he was seized and held down on a block of stone, while a
          priest cut open his breast with a stone knife, and plucking out his
          heart, offered it to the sun. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> His head was hung among the skulls of
          previous victims, and his legs and arms were cooked and prepared
          for the table of the lords. His place was immediately filled up by
          another young man, who for a year was treated with the same
          profound respect, and at the end of it shared the same fate.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea that
          the god thus slain in the person of his representative comes to
          life again immediately, was graphically represented in the Mexican
          ritual by skinning the slain man-god and clothing in his skin a
          living man, who thus became the new representative of the godhead.
          Thus at an annual festival a woman was sacrificed who represented
          Toci or the Mother of the Gods. She was dressed with the ornaments,
          and bore the name of the goddess, whose living image she was
          believed to be. After being feasted and diverted with sham fights
          for several days, she was taken at midnight to the summit of a
          temple, and beheaded on the shoulders of a man. The body was
          immediately flayed, and one of the priests, clothing himself in the
          skin, became the representative of the goddess Toci. The skin of
          the woman's thigh was removed separately, and a young man who
          represented the god Cinteotl, the son of the goddess Toci, wrapt it
          round his face like a mask. Various ceremonies then followed, in
          which the two men, clad in the woman's skin, played the parts
          respectively of the god and goddess.<a id="noteref_600" name=

          Again, at the annual festival of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> god Totec, a number of captives having been
          killed and skinned, a priest clothed himself in one of their skins,
          and thus became the image of the god Totec. Then wearing the
          ornaments of the god—a crown of feathers, golden necklaces and
          ear-rings, scarlet shoes, etc.—he was enthroned, and received
          offerings of the first fruits and first flowers of the season,
          together with bunches of the maize which had been kept for
          seed.<a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601" href=
          "#note_601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a> Every
          fourth year the Quauhtitlans offered sacrifices in honour of the
          god of fire. On the eve of the festival they sacrificed two slaves,
          skinned them, and took out their thigh bones. Next day two priests
          clothed themselves in the skins, took the bones in their hands, and
          with solemn steps and dismal howlings descended the stairs of the
          temple. The people, who were assembled in crowds below, called out,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, there come our gods.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that human sacrifices of the sort I suppose to have prevailed at
          Aricia were, as a matter of fact, systematically offered on a large
          scale by a people whose level of culture was probably not inferior,
          if indeed it was not distinctly superior, to that occupied by the
          Italian races at the early period to which the origin of the
          Arician priesthood must be referred. The positive and indubitable
          evidence of the prevalence of such sacrifices in one part of the
          world may reasonably be allowed to strengthen the probability of
          their prevalence in places for which the evidence is less full and
          trustworthy. Taken all together, the evidence affords a fair
          presumption that the custom of killing men whom their worshippers
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name=
          "Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> regard as divine has
          prevailed in many parts of the world. Whether the general
          explanation which I have offered of that custom is adequate, and
          whether the rule that the priest of Aricia had to die a violent
          death is, as I have tried to show, a particular instance of the
          general custom, are questions which I must now leave to the
          judgment of the reader.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the outset of
          this book two questions were proposed for answer; Why had the
          priest of Nemi (Aricia) to slay his predecessor? And why, before
          doing so, had he to pluck the Golden Bough? Of these two questions
          the first has now been answered. The priest of Nemi, if I am right,
          embodied in himself the spirit, primarily, of the woods and,
          secondarily, of vegetable life in general. Hence, according as he
          was well or ill, the woods, the flowers, and the fields were
          believed to flourish or fade; and if he were to die of sickness or
          old age, the plant world, it was supposed, would simultaneously
          perish. Therefore it was necessary that this priest of the
          woodlands, this sylvan deity incarnate in a man, should be put to
          death while he was still in the full bloom of his divine manhood,
          in order that his sacred life, transmitted in unabated force to his
          successor, might renew its youth, and thus by successive
          transmissions through a perpetual line of vigorous incarnations
          might remain eternally fresh and young, a pledge and security that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name=
          "Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the buds and
          blossoms of spring, the verdure of summer woods, and the mellow
          glories of autumn would never fail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we have
          still to ask, What was the Golden Bough? and why had each candidate
          for the Arician priesthood to pluck it before he could slay the
          priest? These questions I will now try to answer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be well
          to begin by noticing two of those rules or taboos by which, as we
          have seen, the life of divine kings or priests is regulated. The
          first of the rules to which I desire to call the reader's attention
          is that the divine personage may not touch the ground with his
          foot. This rule was observed by the Mikado of Japan and by the
          supreme pontiff of the Zapotecs in Mexico. The latter <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“profaned his sanctity if he so much as touched the
          ground with his foot.”</span><a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603"
          href="#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> For
          the Mikado to touch the ground with his foot was a shameful
          degradation; indeed, in the sixteenth century, it was enough to
          deprive him of his office. Outside his palace he was carried on
          men's shoulders; within it he walked on exquisitely wrought
          mats.<a id="noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href=
          "#note_604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a> The
          king and queen of Tahiti might not touch the ground anywhere but
          within their hereditary domains; for the ground on which they trod

          girls are confined for four or five years in small cages, being
          kept in the dark and not allowed to set foot on the ground. The
          custom has been thus described by an eye-witness. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I heard from a teacher about some strange custom
          connected with some of the young girls here, so I asked the chief
          to take me to the house where they were. The house was about
          twenty-five feet in length, and stood in a reed and bamboo
          enclosure, across the entrance to which a bundle of dried grass was
          suspended to show that it was strictly <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tabu</span></span>’</span>. Inside the house
          were three conical structures about seven or eight feet in height,
          and about ten or twelve feet in circumference at the bottom, and
          for about four feet from the ground, at which point they tapered
          off to a point at the top. These cages were made of the broad
          leaves of the pandanus-tree, sewn quite close <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> together so that no light, and little
          or no air could enter. On one side of each is an opening which is
          closed by a double door of plaited cocoa-nut tree and pandanus-tree
          leaves. About three feet from the ground there is a stage of
          bamboos which forms the floor. In each of these cages we were told
          there was a young woman confined, each of whom had to remain for at
          least four or five years, without ever being allowed to go outside
          the house. I could scarcely credit the story when I heard it; the
          whole thing seemed too horrible to be true. I spoke to the chief,
          and told him that I wished to see the inside of the cages, and also
          to see the girls that I might make them a present of a few beads.
          He told me that it was <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tabu</span></span>,’</span> forbidden for any
          men but their own relations to look at them; but I suppose the
          promised beads acted as an inducement, and so he sent away for some
          old lady who had charge, and who alone is allowed to open the
          doors.... She had to undo the door when the chief told her to do
          so, and then the girls peeped out at us, and, when told to do so,
          they held out their hands for the beads. I, however, purposely sat
          at some distance away and merely held out the beads to them, as I
          wished to draw them quite outside, that I might inspect the inside
          of the cages. This desire of mine gave rise to another difficulty,
          as these girls were not allowed to put their feet to the ground all
          the time they were confined in these places. However, they wished
          to get the beads, and so the old lady had to go outside and collect
          a lot of pieces of wood and bamboo, which she placed on the ground,
          and then going to one of the girls, she helped her down and held
          her hand as she stepped from one piece of wood to another until she
          came near enough to get the beads I held out to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> her. I then went to inspect the inside
          of the cage out of which she had come, but could scarcely put my
          head inside of it, the atmosphere was so hot and stifling. It was
          clean and contained nothing but a few short lengths of bamboo for
          holding water. There was only room for the girl to sit or lie down
          in a crouched position on the bamboo platform, and when the doors
          are shut it must be nearly or quite dark inside. The girls are
          never allowed to come out except once a day to bathe in a dish or
          wooden bowl placed close to each cage. They say that they perspire
          profusely. They are placed in these stifling cages when quite
          young, and must remain there until they are young women, when they
          are taken out and have each a great marriage feast provided for
          them.”</span><a id="noteref_615" name="noteref_615" href=

          in almost total darkness. She may not leave the room on any pretext
          whatever, not even for the most necessary purposes. None of her
          family may see her all the time she is shut up, but a single slave
          woman is appointed to wait on her. During her lonely confinement,
          which often lasts seven years, the girl occupies herself in weaving
          mats or with other handiwork. Her bodily growth is stunted by the
          long want of exercise, and when, on attaining womanhood, she is
          brought out, her complexion is pale and wax-like. She is now shown

          places, to six months. The girl has to wear a sort of hat with long

          Amongst some of the Brazilian Indians, when a girl attained to
          puberty, her hair was burned or shaved off close to the head. Then
          she was placed on a flat stone and cut with the tooth of an animal
          from the shoulders all down the back, till she ran with blood. Then
          the ashes of a wild gourd were rubbed into the wounds; the girl was
          bound hand and foot, and hung in a hammock, being enveloped in it
          so closely that no one could see her. Here she had to stay for
          three days without eating or drinking. When the three days were
          over, she stepped out of the hammock upon the flat stone, for her
          feet might not touch the ground. If she had a call of nature, a
          female relation took the girl on her back and carried her out,
          taking with her a live coal to prevent evil influences from
          entering the girl's body. Being replaced in her hammock she was now
          allowed to get some flour, boiled roots, and water, but might not
          taste salt or flesh. Thus she continued to the end <span class=

          expiry of which she was gashed on the breast and belly as well as
          all down the back. During the second month she still stayed in her
          hammock, but her rule of abstinence was less rigid, and she was
          allowed to spin. The third month she was blackened with a certain

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amongst the
          Macusis of British Guiana, when a girl shows the first signs of
          puberty, she is hung in a hammock at the highest point of the hut.
          For the first few days she may not leave the hammock by day, but at
          night she must come down, light a fire, and spend the night beside
          it, else she would break out in sores on her neck, throat, etc. So
          long as the symptoms are at their height, she must fast rigorously.
          When they have abated, she may come down and take up her abode in a
          little compartment that is made for her in the darkest corner of
          the hut. In the morning she may cook her food, but it must be at a
          separate fire and in a vessel of her own. In about ten days the
          magician comes and undoes the spell by muttering charms and
          breathing on her and on the more valuable of the things with which
          she has come in contact. The pots and drinking vessels which she
          used are broken and the fragments buried. After her first bath, the

          the malignant influences with which a girl at such times is

          always originated with a similar intention. It was meant to wipe
          off and drive away a dangerous contagion (whether personified as
          demoniacal or not) which was supposed to be adhering physically,
          though invisibly, to the body of the sufferer.<a id="noteref_628"

          234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the person beaten was no more the object of the beating than it is
          of a surgical operation with us; it was a necessary accident, that
          was all. In later times such customs were interpreted otherwise,
          and the pain, from being an accident, became the prime object of
          the ceremony, which was now regarded either as a test of endurance
          imposed upon persons at critical epochs of life, or as a
          mortification of the flesh well pleasing to the god. But
          asceticism, under any shape or form, is never primitive. Amongst
          the Uaupes of Brazil a girl at puberty is secluded in the house for
          a month, and allowed only a small quantity of bread and water. Then
          she is taken out into the midst of her relations and friends, each
          of whom gives her four or five blows with pieces of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sipo</span></span> (an elastic climber), till
          she falls senseless or dead. If she recovers, the operation is
          repeated four times at intervals of six hours, and it is considered
          an offence to the parents not to strike hard. Meantime, pots of
          meats and fish have been made ready; the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sipos</span></span> are dipped into them and
          then given to the girl to lick, who is now considered a

          tales. It has its counterpart in the legend which the Kirgis of
          Siberia tell of their ancestry. A certain Khan had a fair daughter,
          whom he kept in a dark iron house, that no man might see her. An
          old woman tended her; and when the girl was grown to maidenhood she
          asked the old woman, <span class="tei tei-q">“Where do you go so

          the iron house. But when she saw the bright world, the girl
          tottered and fainted; and the eye of God fell upon her, and she
          conceived. Her angry father put her in a golden chest and sent her

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ground of
          this seclusion of girls at puberty lies in the deeply engrained
          dread which primitive man universally entertains of menstruous
          blood. Evidence of this has already been adduced,<a id=

          few more facts may here be added. Amongst the Australian blacks
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the boys are told from their infancy that,
          if they see the blood, they will early become gray-headed, and
          their strength will fail prematurely.”</span> Hence a woman lives
          apart at these times; and if a young man or boy approaches her she
          calls out, and he immediately makes a circuit to avoid her. The men
          go out of their way to avoid even crossing the tracks made by women
          at such times. Similarly the woman may not walk on any path
          frequented by men, nor touch anything used by men; she may not eat
          fish, or go near water at all, much less cross it; for if she did,
          the fish would be frightened, and the fishers would have no luck;
          she may not even fetch water for the camp; it is sufficient for her
          to say <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Thama</span></span> to ensure her husband
          fetching the water himself. A severe beating, or even death, is the

          surprised and cut off by enemies. It was thought <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a most horrid and dangerous pollution”</span> to go
          near the women at such times; and the danger extended to enemies
          who, if they slew the women, had to cleanse themselves from the
          pollution by means of certain sacred herbs and roots.<a id=

          Similarly, among the Chippeways and other Indians of the Hudson Bay
          Territory, women at such seasons are excluded from the camp, and
          take up their abode in huts of branches. They wear long hoods,
          which effectually conceal the head and breast. They may not touch
          the household furniture nor any objects used by men; for their
          touch <span class="tei tei-q">“is supposed to defile them, so that
          their subsequent use would be followed by certain mischief or
          misfortune,”</span> such as disease or death. They may not walk on
          the common paths nor cross the tracks of animals. They <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“are never permitted to walk on the ice of rivers or
          lakes, or near the part where the men are hunting beaver, or where
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name=

          set, for fear of averting their success. They are also prohibited
          at those times from partaking of the head of any animal, and even
          from walking in or crossing the track where the head of a deer,
          moose, beaver, and many other animals have lately been carried,
          either on a sledge or on the back. To be guilty of a violation of
          this custom is considered as of the greatest importance; because

          list of dangers apprehended from menstruation is longer than any
          furnished by savages. According to Pliny, the touch of a menstruous
          woman turned wine to vinegar, blighted crops, killed seedlings,
          blasted gardens, brought down the fruit from trees, dimmed mirrors,
          blunted razors, rusted iron and brass (especially at the waning of
          the moon), killed bees, or at least drove them from their hives,
          caused mares to miscarry, and so forth.<a id="noteref_647" name=

          Similarly, in various parts of Europe, it is still believed that if
          a woman in her courses enters a brewery the beer will turn sour; if

          makes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name=
          "Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> jam, it will not
          keep; if she mounts a mare, it will miscarry; if she touches buds,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the object
          of secluding women at menstruation is to neutralise the dangerous
          influences which are supposed to emanate from them at such times.
          That the danger is believed to be especially great at the first
          menstruation appears from the unusual precautions taken to isolate
          girls at this crisis. Two of these precautions have been
          illustrated above, namely, the rules that the girl may not touch
          the ground nor see the sun. The general effect of these rules is to
          keep the girl suspended, so to say, between heaven and earth.
          Whether enveloped in her hammock and slung up to the roof, as in
          South America, or elevated above the ground in a dark and narrow
          cage, as in New Ireland, she may be considered to be out of the way
          of doing mischief, since, being shut off both from the earth and
          from the sun, she can poison neither of these great sources of life
          by her deadly contagion. In short, she is rendered harmless by
          being, in electrical language, insulated. But the precautions thus
          taken to isolate or insulate the girl are dictated by a regard for
          her own safety as well as for the safety of others. For it is
          thought that the girl herself would suffer if she were to neglect
          the prescribed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
          242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          regimen. Thus Zulu girls, as we have seen, believe that they would
          shrivel to skeletons if the sun were to shine on them at puberty,
          and in some Brazilian tribes the girls think that a transgression
          of the rules would entail sores on the neck and throat. In short,
          the girl is viewed as charged with a powerful force which, if not
          kept within bounds, may prove the destruction both of the girl
          herself and of all with whom she comes in contact. To repress this
          force within the limits necessary for the safety of all concerned
          is the object of the taboos in question.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same
          explanation applies to the observance of the same rules by divine
          kings and priests. The uncleanness, as it is called, of girls at
          puberty and the sanctity of holy men do not, to the primitive mind,
          differ from each other. They are only different manifestations of
          the same supernatural energy which, like energy in general, is in
          itself neither good nor bad, but becomes beneficent or maleficent
          according to its application.<a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649"
          href="#note_649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a>
          Accordingly, if, like girls at puberty, divine personages may
          neither touch the ground nor see the sun, the reason is, on the one
          hand, a fear lest their divinity might, at contact with earth or
          heaven, discharge itself with fatal violence on either; and, on the
          other hand, an apprehension, that the divine being, thus drained of
          his ethereal virtue, might thereby be incapacitated for the future
          performance of those supernatural functions, upon the proper
          discharge of which the safety of the people and even of the world
          is believed to hang. Thus the rules in question fall under the head
          of the taboos which we examined in the second chapter; they are
          intended to preserve the life <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          his subjects and worshippers. Nowhere, it is thought, can his
          precious yet dangerous life be at once so safe and so harmless as
          when it is neither in heaven nor in earth, but, as far as possible,
          suspended between the two.<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A god whose life
          might in a sense be said to be neither in heaven nor earth but
          between the two, was the Norse Balder, the good and beautiful god.
          The story of his death is as follows: Once on a time Balder dreamed
          heavy dreams which seemed to forebode his death. Thereupon the gods
          held a council and resolved to make him secure against every
          danger. So the goddess Frigg took an oath from fire and water, iron
          and all metals, stones and earth, from trees, sicknesses and
          poisons, and from all four-footed beasts, birds, and creeping
          things, that they would not hurt Balder. When this was done Balder
          was deemed invulnerable; so the gods amused themselves by setting
          him in their midst, while some shot at him, others hewed at him,
          and others threw stones at him. But whatever they did, nothing
          could hurt him; and at this they were all glad. Only Loki, the
          mischief-maker, was displeased, and he went in the guise of an old
          woman to Frigg, who told him that the weapons of the gods could not
          wound Balder, since she had made them all swear not to hurt him.
          Then Loki asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Have all things sworn to
          spare Balder?”</span> She answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“East
          of Walhalla grows a plant called mistletoe; it seemed to me too
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name=
          "Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> young to
          swear.”</span> So Loki went and pulled the mistletoe and took it to
          the assembly of the gods. There he found the blind god Hödur
          standing at the outside of the circle. Loki asked him, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why do you not shoot at Balder?”</span> Hödur
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Because I do not see where he
          stands; besides I have no weapon.”</span> Then said Loki,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Do like the rest and show Balder honour,
          as they all do. I will show you where he stands, and do you shoot
          at him with this twig.”</span> Hödur took the mistletoe and threw
          it at Balder, as Loki directed him. The mistletoe struck Balder and
          pierced him through and through, and he fell down dead. And that
          was the greatest misfortune that ever befel gods and men. For a
          while the gods stood speechless, then they lifted up their voices
          and wept bitterly. They took Balder's body and brought it to the
          sea-shore. There stood Balder's ship; it was called Ringhorn, and
          was the hugest of all ships. The gods wished to launch the ship and
          to burn Balder's body on it, but the ship would not stir. So they
          sent for a giantess called Hyrrockin. She came riding on a wolf and
          gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and
          all the earth shook. Then Balder's body was taken and placed on the
          funeral pile upon his ship. When his wife Nanna saw that, her heart
          burst for sorrow and she died. So she was laid on the funeral pile
          with her husband, and fire was put to it. Balder's horse, too, with
          all its trappings, was burned on the pile.<a id="noteref_651" name=
          "noteref_651" href="#note_651"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          circumstantiality of this story suggests that it belongs to the
          extensive class of myths which are invented <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to explain ritual. For a myth is never
          so graphic and precise in its details as when it is a simple
          transcript of a ceremony which the author of the myth witnessed
          with his eyes. At all events, if it can be made probable that rites
          like those described in the Balder myth have been practised by
          Norsemen and by other European peoples, we shall be justified in
          inferring that the ritual gave birth to the myth, not the myth to
          the ritual. For while many cases can be shown in which a myth has
          been invented to explain a rite, it would be hard to point to a
          single case in which a myth has given rise to a rite. Ritual may be
          the parent of myth, but can never be its child.<a id="noteref_652"
          name="noteref_652" href="#note_652"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The main
          incidents in the myth of Balder's death are two; first, the pulling
          of the mistletoe, and second, the death and burning of the god. Now
          both these incidents appear to have formed parts of an annual
          ceremony once observed by Celts and Norsemen, probably also by
          Germans and Slavs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In most parts of
          Europe the peasants have been accustomed from time immemorial to
          kindle bonfires on certain days of the year, and to dance round
          them or leap over them. Customs of this kind can be traced back on
          historical evidence to the Middle Ages,<a id="noteref_653" name=
          "noteref_653" href="#note_653"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a> and
          their analogy to similar customs observed in antiquity goes with
          strong internal evidence to prove that their origin must be sought
          in a period long <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
          247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          prior to the spread of Christianity. Indeed the earliest evidence
          of their observance in Northern Europe is furnished by the attempts
          made by Christian synods in the eighth century to put them down as
          heathenish rites.<a id="noteref_654" name="noteref_654" href=
          "#note_654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a> Not
          uncommonly effigies are burned in these fires, or a pretence is
          made of burning a living person in them; and there are grounds for
          believing that anciently human beings were actually burned on these
          occasions. A brief review of the customs in question will bring out
          the traces of human sacrifice, and will serve at the same time to
          throw light on their meaning.<a id="noteref_655" name="noteref_655"
          href="#note_655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The seasons of
          the year at which these bonfires are most commonly lit are spring
          and midsummer, but in some places they are kindled at Hallow E'en
          (October 31st) and Christmas. In spring the first Sunday in Lent
          (Quadragesima) and Easter Eve are the days on which in different
          places the ceremony is observed. Thus in the Eifel Mountains,
          Rhenish Prussia, on the first Sunday in Lent young people used to
          collect straw and brushwood from house to house. These they carried
          to an eminence and piled them up round a tall, slim, beech-tree, to
          which a piece of wood was fastened at right angles to form a cross.
          The structure was known as the <span class="tei tei-q">“hut”</span>
          or <span class="tei tei-q">“castle.”</span> Fire was set to it and
          the young people marched round the blazing <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“castle”</span> bareheaded, each carrying a lighted
          torch and praying aloud. Sometimes a straw man was burned in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“hut.”</span> People observed the direction
          in which the smoke blew from the fire. If it blew towards the
          corn-fields, it was a sign that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> harvest would be abundant. On the same day,
          in some parts of the Eifel, a great wheel was made of straw and
          dragged by three horses to the top of a hill. Thither the village
          boys marched at nightfall, set fire to the wheel, and sent it
          rolling down the slope. Two lads followed it with levers to set it
          in motion again, in case it should anywhere meet with a
          check.<a id="noteref_656" name="noteref_656" href=
          "#note_656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">656</span></span></a> About
          Echternach the same ceremony is called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“burning the witch.”</span><a id="noteref_657" name=

          Voralberg in the Tyrol on the first Sunday in Lent a slender young
          fir-tree is surrounded with a pile of straw and fire-wood. At the
          top of the tree is fastened a human figure called the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“witch”</span>; it is made of old clothes and stuffed
          with gunpowder. At night the whole is set on fire and boys and
          girls dance round it, swinging torches and singing rhymes in which
          the words <span class="tei tei-q">“corn in the winnowing-basket,
          the plough in the earth”</span> may be distinguished.<a id=
          "noteref_658" name="noteref_658" href="#note_658"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">658</span></span></a> In
          Swabia on the first Sunday in Lent a figure called the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“witch”</span> or the <span class="tei tei-q">“old
          wife”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“winter's
          grandmother”</span> is made up of clothes and fastened to a pole.
          This is stuck in the middle of a pile of wood, to which fire is
          applied. While the <span class="tei tei-q">“witch”</span> is
          burning the young people throw blazing discs into the air. The
          discs are thin round pieces of wood, a few inches in diameter, with
          notched edges to imitate the rays of the sun or stars. They have a
          hole in the middle, by which they are attached to the end of a
          wand. Before the disc is thrown it is set on fire, the wand is
          swung to and fro, and the impetus thus communicated to the disc is
          augmented by dashing the rod sharply against a sloping board. The
          burning disc is thus thrown off, and mounting <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> high into the air, describes a long
          curve before it reaches the ground. A single lad may fling up forty
          or fifty of these discs, one after the other. The object is to
          throw them as high as possible. The wand by which they are hurled
          must, at least in some parts of Swabia, be of hazel. Sometimes the
          lads also leap over the fire brandishing blazing torches of
          pine-wood. The charred embers of the burned <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“witch”</span> and discs are taken home and planted in
          the flax-fields the same night, in the belief that they will keep
          vermin from the fields.<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href=
          "#note_659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          the Rhön Mountains, Bavaria, on the first Sunday in Lent the people
          used to march to the top of a hill or eminence. Children and lads
          carried torches, brooms daubed with tar, and poles swathed in
          straw. A wheel, wrapt in combustibles, was kindled and rolled down
          the hill; and the young people rushed about the fields with their
          burning torches and brooms, till at last they flung them in a heap,
          and standing round them, struck up a hymn or a popular song. The
          object of running about the fields with the blazing torches was to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“drive away the wicked sower.”</span> Or it
          was done in honour of the Virgin, that she might preserve the
          fruits of the earth throughout the year and bless them.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems hardly
          possible to separate from these bonfires, kindled on the first
          Sunday in Lent, the fires in which, about the same season, the
          effigy called Death is burned as part of the ceremony of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“carrying out Death.”</span> We have seen
          that at Spachendorf, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
          250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Austrian Silesia, on the morning of Rupert's Day (Shrove Tuesday?)
          a straw-man, dressed in a fur coat and a fur cap, is laid in a hole
          outside the village and there burned, and that while it is blazing
          every one seeks to snatch a fragment of it, which he fastens to a
          branch of the highest tree in his garden or buries in his field,
          believing that this will make the crops to grow better. The
          ceremony is known as the <span class="tei tei-q">“burying of
          Death.”</span><a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href=

          when the straw-man is not designated as Death, the meaning of the
          observance is probably the same; for the name Death, as I have
          tried to show, does not express the original intention of the
          ceremony. At Cobern in the Eifel Mountains the lads make up a
          straw-man on Shrove Tuesday. The effigy is formally tried and
          accused of having perpetrated all the thefts that have been
          committed in the neighbourhood throughout the year. Being condemned
          to death, the straw-man is led through the village, shot, and
          burned upon a pyre. They dance round the blazing pile, and the last
          bride must leap over it.<a id="noteref_662" name="noteref_662"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another occasion
          on which these fire-festivals are held is Easter Eve, the Saturday
          before Easter Sunday. On that day it has been customary in Catholic
          countries to extinguish all the lights in the churches, and then to
          make a new fire, sometimes with flint and steel, sometimes with a
          burning-glass. At this fire is lit the Easter candle, which is then
          used to rekindle all the extinguished lights in the church. In many
          parts of Germany a bonfire is also kindled, by means of the new
          fire, on some open space near the church. It is consecrated, and
          the people bring sticks of oak, walnut, and beech, which they char
          in the fire, and then take home with them. Some of these charred
          sticks are thereupon burned at home in a newly-kindled fire, with a
          prayer that God will preserve the homestead from fire, lightning,
          and hail. Thus every house receives <span class="tei tei-q">“new
          fire.”</span> Some of the sticks are placed in the fields, gardens,
          and meadows, with a prayer that God will keep them from blight and
          hail. Such fields and gardens are thought to thrive more than
          others; the corn and the plants that grow in them are not beaten
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name=
          "Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> down by hail, nor
          devoured by mice, vermin, and beetles, no witch harms them, and the
          ears of corn stand close and full. The charred sticks are also
          applied to the plough. The ashes of the Easter bonfire, together
          with the ashes of the consecrated palm-branches, are mixed with the
          seed at sowing. A wooden figure called Judas is sometimes burned in
          the consecrated bonfire.<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668"
          href="#note_668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes
          instead of the consecrated bonfire a profane fire used to be
          kindled on Easter Eve. In the afternoon the lads of the village
          collected firewood and carried it to a corn-field or to the top of
          a hill. Here they piled it together and fastened in the midst of it
          a pole with a cross-piece, all wrapt in straw, so that it looked
          like a man with outstretched arms. This figure was called the
          Easter-man, or the Judas. In the evening the lads lit their
          lanterns at the new holy fire in the church, and ran at full speed
          to the pile. The one who reached it first set fire to it and to the
          effigy. No women or girls might be present, though they were
          allowed to watch the scene from a distance. Great was the joy while
          the effigy was burning. The ashes were collected and thrown at
          sunrise into running water, or were scattered over the fields on
          Easter Monday. At the same time the palm branches which had been
          consecrated on Palm Sunday, and sticks which had been charred in
          the fire and consecrated on Good Friday, were also stuck up in the
          fields. The object was to preserve the fields from hail.<a id=

          "Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> certain definite
          hills, which are hence known as Easter or Pascal Mountains. The
          whole community assembles about the fire. Fathers of families form
          an inner circle round it. An outer circle is formed by the young
          men and maidens, who, singing Easter hymns, march round and round
          the fire in the direction of the sun, till the blaze dies down.
          Then the girls jump over the fire in a line, one after the other,
          each supported by two young men who hold her hands and run beside
          her. When the fire has burned out, the whole assemblage marches in
          solemn procession to the church, singing hymns. They march thrice
          round the church, and then break up. In the twilight boys with
          blazing bundles of straw run over the fields to make them
          fruitful.<a id="noteref_670" name="noteref_670" href=

          Holland, also, Easter fires used to be kindled on the highest
          eminences, the people danced round them, and leaped through the
          flames.<a id="noteref_671" name="noteref_671" href=

          Schaumburg, the Easter bonfires may be seen blazing on all the
          mountains around for miles. They are made with a tar barrel
          fastened to a pine-tree, which is wrapt in straw. The people dance
          singing round them.<a id="noteref_672" name="noteref_672" href=

          Easter bonfires are also common in the Harz Mountains and in
          Brunswick, Hanover, and Westphalia. They are generally lit upon
          particular heights and mountains which are hence called Easter
          Mountains. In the Harz the fire is commonly made by piling
          brushwood about a tree and setting it on fire, and blazing tar
          barrels are often rolled down into the valley. In Osterode, every
          one tries to snatch a brand from the bonfire and rushes about with
          it; the better it burns, the more lucky it is. In Grund there are
          torch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name=

          the Altmark, the Easter bonfires are composed of tar barrels,
          bee-hives, etc., piled round a pole. The young folk dance round the
          fire; and when it has died out, the old folk come and collect the
          ashes, which they preserve as a remedy for the ailments of bees. It
          is also believed that as far as the blaze of the bonfire is
          visible, the corn will grow well throughout the year, and no
          conflagration will break out.<a id="noteref_674" name="noteref_674"

          some parts of Bavaria, bonfires were kindled at Easter upon steep
          mountains, and burning arrows or discs of wood were shot high into
          the air, as in the Swabian custom already described. Sometimes,
          instead of the discs, an old waggon wheel was wrapt in straw, set
          on fire, and sent rolling down the mountain. The lads who hurled
          the discs received painted Easter eggs from the girls.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the central
          Highlands of Scotland bonfires, known as the Beltane fires, were
          formerly kindled with great ceremony on the 1st of May, and the
          traces of human sacrifices at them were particularly clear and
          unequivocal. In the neighbourhood of Callander, in Perthshire, the
          custom lasted down to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
          255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the close of last century. The fires were lit by the people of each
          hamlet on a hill or knoll round which their cattle were pasturing.
          Hence various eminences in the Highlands are known as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the hill of the fires,”</span> just as in Germany some
          mountains take their name from the Easter fires which are kindled
          upon them. On the morning of May Day the people repaired to a hill
          or knoll and cut a round trench in the green sod, leaving in the
          centre a platform of turf large enough to contain the whole
          company. On this turf they seated themselves, and in the middle was
          placed a pile of wood or other fuel, which of old they kindled with
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tein-eigin</span></span>—that is, forced fire
          or need-fire. The way of making the need-fire was this:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The night before, all the fires in the
          country were carefully extinguished, and next morning the materials
          for exciting this sacred fire were prepared. The most primitive
          method seems to be that which was used in the islands of Skye,
          Mull, and Tiree. A well-seasoned plank of oak was procured, in the
          midst of which a hole was bored. A wimble of the same timber was
          then applied, the end of which they fitted to the hole. But in some
          parts of the mainland the machinery was different. They used a
          frame of green wood, of a square form, in the centre of which was
          an axle-tree. In some places three times three persons, in others
          three times nine, were required for turning round, by turns, the
          axle-tree or wimble. If any of them had been guilty of murder,
          adultery, theft, or other atrocious crime, it was imagined either
          that the fire would not kindle, or that it would be devoid of its
          usual virtue. So soon as any sparks were emitted by means of the
          violent friction, they applied a species of agaric which grows on
          old birch-trees, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg
          256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and is very combustible. This fire had the appearance of being
          immediately derived from heaven, and manifold were the virtues
          ascribed to it. They esteemed it a preservative against witchcraft,
          and a sovereign remedy against malignant diseases, both in the
          human species and in cattle; and by it the strongest poisons were
          supposed to have their nature changed.”</span> For many years,
          however, before the close of last century, the Beltane fires were
          kindled in the usual way. The fire being lit, the company prepared
          a custard of eggs and milk, which they ate. Afterwards they amused
          themselves a while by singing and dancing round the fire. Then
          <span class="tei tei-q">“they knead a cake of oatmeal, which is
          toasted at the embers against a stone. After the custard is eaten
          up they divide the cake into so many portions, as similar as
          possible to one another in size and shape, as there are persons in
          the company. They daub one of these portions all over with charcoal
          until it be perfectly black. They put all the bits of cake into a
          bonnet. Every one, blindfold, draws out a portion. He who holds the
          bonnet is entitled to the last bit. Whoever draws the black bit is
          the devoted person who is to be sacrificed to <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Baal</span></span>, whose favour they mean to
          implore, in rendering the year productive of the sustenance of man
          and beast.”</span> The victim thus selected <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“was called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cailleach bealtine</span></span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
          the Beltane <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">carline</span></span>, a term of great
          reproach. Upon his being known, part of the company laid hold of
          him, and made a show of putting him into the fire; but, the
          majority interposing, he was rescued. And in some places they laid
          him flat on the ground, making as if they would quarter him.
          Afterwards he was pelted with eggshells, and retained the odious
          appellation during the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg
          257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          whole year. And, while the feast was fresh in people's memory, they
          affected to speak of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cailleach bealtine</span></span> as
          dead.”</span> He had to leap thrice through the flames, and this
          concluded the ceremony.<a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679" href=
          "#note_679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another account
          of the Beltane festival, written in the latter half of last
          century, is as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“On the 1st of May
          the herdsmen of every village hold their Beltien, a rural
          sacrifice. They cut a square trench on the ground, leaving the turf
          in the middle; on that they make a fire of wood, on which they
          dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal, and milk, and bring,
          besides the ingredients of the caudle, plenty of beer and whisky;
          for each of the company must contribute something. The rites begin
          with spilling some of the caudle on the ground, by way of libation;
          on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are raised
          nine square knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the
          supposed preserver of their flocks and herds, or to some particular
          animal, the real destroyer of them; each person then turns his face
          to the fire, breaks off a knob, and, flinging it over his shoulder,
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘This I give to thee, preserve thou
          my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep; and so on.’</span>
          After that they use the same ceremony to the noxious animals:
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘This I give to thee, O fox! spare thou my
          lambs; this to thee, O hooded crow! this to thee, O eagle!’</span>
          When the ceremony is over they dine on the caudle; and, after the
          feast is finished, what is left is hid by two persons deputed for
          that purpose; but on the next Sunday they reassemble, and finish
          the reliques of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg
          258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          first entertainment.”</span><a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680"
          href="#note_680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a> The
          1st of May is a great popular festival in the more midland and
          southern parts of Sweden. On the preceding evening huge bonfires,
          which should be lighted by striking two flints together, blaze on
          all the hills and knolls. Every large hamlet has its own fire,
          round which the young people dance in a ring. The old folk notice
          whether the flames incline to the north or to the south. In the
          former case the spring will be cold and backward; in the latter
          mild and genial.<a id="noteref_681" name="noteref_681" href=
          "#note_681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the season
          at which these fire-festivals are most generally held all over
          Europe is the summer solstice, that is, Midsummer Eve (23d June) or
          Midsummer Day (24th June). According to a mediæval writer the three
          great features of this festival were the bonfires, the procession
          with torches round the fields, and the custom of rolling a wheel.
          The writer adds that the smoke drives away harmful dragons which
          cause sickness, and he explains the custom of rolling the wheel to
          mean that the sun has now reached the highest point in the
          ecliptic, and begins thenceforward to descend.<a id="noteref_682"
          name="noteref_682" href="#note_682"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a> From
          his description, which is still applicable, we see that the main
          features of the midsummer fire-festival are identical with those
          which characterise the spring festivals. In Swabia lads and lasses,
          hand in hand, leap over the midsummer bonfire, praying that the
          hemp may grow three ells high, and they set fire to wheels of straw
          and send them rolling down the hill.<a id="noteref_683" name=
          "noteref_683" href="#note_683"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">683</span></span></a> In
          Lechrain bonfires are kindled on <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the mountains on Midsummer Day; and besides
          the bonfire a tall beam, thickly wrapt in straw, and surmounted by
          a cross-piece, is burned in many places. Round this cross, as it
          burns, the lads dance; and when the flames have subsided, the young
          people leap over the fire in pairs, a young man and a young woman
          together. It is believed that the flax will grow that year as high
          as they leap over the fire; and that if a charred billet be taken
          from the fire and stuck in a flax field it will promote the growth
          of the flax.<a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href=

          Deffingen, as they jumped over the midsummer bonfire, they cried
          out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Flax, flax! may the flax this year

          Bohemia bonfires are kindled on many of the mountains on Midsummer
          Eve; boys and girls, hand in hand, leap over them; cart-wheels
          smeared with resin are ignited and sent rolling down the hill; and
          brooms covered with tar and set on fire are swung about or thrown
          high into the air. The handles of the brooms or embers from the
          fire are preserved and stuck in gardens to protect the vegetables
          from caterpillars and gnats. Sometimes the boys run down the
          hillside in troops, brandishing the blazing brooms and shouting.
          The bonfire is sometimes made by stacking wood and branches round
          the trunk of a tree and setting the whole on fire.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In old
          farm-houses of the Surenthal and Winenthal a couple of holes or a
          whole row of them may sometimes be seen facing each other in the
          door-posts of the barn or stable. Sometimes the holes are smooth
          and round; sometimes they are deeply burnt and blackened.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name=
          "Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The explanation of
          them is this. About midsummer, but especially on Midsummer Day, two
          such holes are bored opposite each other, into which the
          extremities of a strong pole are fixed. The holes are then stuffed
          with tow steeped in resin and oil; a rope is looped round the pole,
          and two young men, who must be brothers or must have the same
          baptismal name, and must be of the same age, pull the ends of the

          till smoke and sparks issue from the two holes in the door-posts.
          The sparks are caught and blown up with tinder, and this is the new
          and pure fire, the appearance of which is greeted with cries of
          joy. Heaps of combustible materials are now ignited with the new
          fire, and blazing bundles are placed on boards and sent floating
          down the brook. The boys light torches at the new fire and run to
          fumigate the pastures. This is believed to drive away all the
          demons and witches that molest the cattle. Finally the torches are
          thrown in a heap on the meadow and allowed to burn out. On their
          way back the boys strew the ashes over the fields: this is supposed
          to make them fertile. If a farmer has taken possession of a new
          house, or if servants have changed masters, the boys fumigate the
          new abode and are rewarded by the farmer with a supper.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Konz, on the
          Moselle, the midsummer fire-festival used to be celebrated as
          follows. A quantity of straw, contributed jointly by every house,
          was collected on the top of the Stromberg Hill. Here, towards
          evening, the men and boys assembled, while the women and girls took
          up their position at a certain well down below. On the top of the
          hill a huge wheel was completely covered with a portion of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name=
          "Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> collected straw, the
          remainder of which was made into torches. The mayor of Sierk, who
          always received a basket of cherries for his services, gave the
          signal, the wheel was ignited with a torch, and sent rolling down
          the hill amid shouts of joy. All the men and boys swung their
          torches in the air, some of them remained on the top of the hill,
          while others followed the fiery wheel on its course down the
          hillside to the Moselle. As it passed the women and girls at the
          well they raised cries of joy which were answered by the men on the
          top of the hill. The inhabitants of the neighbouring villages also
          stood on the banks of the river and mingled their voices with the
          general shout of jubilation. The wheel was often extinguished
          before it reached the water, but if it plunged blazing into the
          river the people expected an abundant vintage, and the inhabitants
          of Konz had the right to exact a waggon-load of white wine from the
          surrounding vineyards.<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href=

          midsummer customs are similar. In Poitou a wheel enveloped in straw
          is set on fire, and people run with it through the fields, which
          are supposed to be fertilised thereby; also, the people leap thrice
          over the fire, holding in their hands branches of nut-trees, which
          are afterwards hung over the door of the cattle-stall. At Brest
          torches are brandished, and hundreds of them flung up into the air

          the open streets. Young and old gathered round them; the former
          leaped over the fires and engaged in games, while the old people
          looked on. Sometimes the fires were kindled on the tops of high

          of St. John. On Sunday night bonfires were observed throughout
          nearly every county in the province of Leinster. In Kilkenny fires
          blazed on every hillside at intervals of about a mile. There were
          very many in the Queen's county, also in Kildare and Wexford. The
          effect in the rich sunset appeared to travellers very grand. The
          people assemble and dance round the fires, the children jump

          fires was not uncommon. At Rottenburg in Würtemberg, down
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name=
          "Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to the beginning of
          the present century, a ceremony was observed on Midsummer Day which
          was called <span class="tei tei-q">“beheading the
          angel-man.”</span> A stump was driven into the ground, wrapt with
          straw, and fashioned into the rude likeness of a human figure, with
          arms, head, and face. This was the angel-man; round about him wood
          was piled up. The boys, armed with swords, assembled in crowds,
          covered the figure completely over with flowers, and eagerly
          awaited the signal. When the pile of wood was fired and the
          angel-man burst into a blaze, the word was given and all the boys
          fell upon him with their swords and hewed the burning figure in
          pieces. Then they leaped backwards and forwards over the
          fire.<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href=

          some parts of the Tyrol a straw-man is carted about the village on

          always burned in the midsummer bonfire, and the figure of a woman

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The best general
          explanation of these European <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> fire-festivals seems to be the one given by
          Mannhardt, namely, that they are sun-charms or magical ceremonies
          intended to ensure a proper supply of sunshine for men, animals,
          and plants. We have seen that savages resort to charms for making
          sunshine,<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href=
          "#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a> and
          we need not wonder that primitive man in Europe has done the same.
          Indeed, considering the cold and cloudy climate of Europe during a
          considerable part of the year, it is natural that sun-charms should
          have played a much more prominent part among the superstitious
          practices of European peoples than among those of savages who live
          nearer the equator. This view of the festivals in question is
          supported by various considerations drawn partly from the rites
          themselves, partly from the influence which they are believed to
          exert upon the weather and on vegetation. For example, the custom
          of rolling a burning wheel down a hillside, which is often observed
          on these occasions, seems a very natural imitation of the sun's
          course in the sky, and the imitation is especially appropriate on
          Midsummer Day when the sun's annual declension begins. Not less
          graphic is the imitation of his apparent revolution by swinging a
          burning tar-barrel round a pole.<a id="noteref_727" name=
          "noteref_727" href="#note_727"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">727</span></span></a> The
          custom of throwing blazing discs, shaped like suns, into the air is
          probably also a piece of imitative magic. In these, as in so many
          cases, the magic force is supposed to take effect through mimicry
          or sympathy; by imitating the desired result you actually produce
          it; by counterfeiting the sun's progress through the heavens you
          really help the luminary to pursue his celestial journey with
          punctuality and despatch. The name <span class="tei tei-q">“fire of
          heaven,”</span> by which the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> midsummer fire is sometimes popularly
          known,<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href=
          "#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          clearly indicates a consciousness of the connection between the
          earthly and the heavenly flame.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          manner in which the fire appears to have been originally kindled on
          these occasions favours the view that it was intended to be a
          mock-sun. For, as various scholars have seen,<a id="noteref_729"
          name="noteref_729" href="#note_729"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a> it is
          highly probable that originally at these festivals fire was
          universally obtained by the friction of two pieces of wood. We have
          seen that this is still the case in some places both at the Easter
          and midsummer fires, and that it is expressly stated to have been
          formerly the case at the Beltane fires.<a id="noteref_730" name=
          "noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> But
          what makes it almost certain that this was once the invariable mode
          of kindling the fire at these periodic festivals is the analogy of
          the need-fires. Need-fires are kindled, not at fixed periods, but
          on occasions of special distress, particularly at the outbreak of a
          murrain, and the cattle are driven through the need-fire, just as
          they are sometimes driven through the midsummer fires.<a id=
          "noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a> Now,
          the need-fire has always been produced by the friction of wood and
          sometimes by the revolution of a wheel; in Mull, for example, it
          was made by turning an oaken wheel over nine oaken spindles from
          east to west, that is, in the direction of the sun. It is a
          plausible conjecture that the wheel employed to produce the
          need-fire represents the sun;<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732"
          href="#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a> and
          if the spring and midsummer fires were originally produced in the
          same way, it would be a confirmation <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the view that they were originally
          sun-charms. In point of fact there is, as Kuhn has pointed
          out,<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href=
          "#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a> some
          evidence to show that the midsummer fire was originally thus
          produced. For at Obermedlingen in Swabia the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“fire of heaven,”</span> as it was called, was made on
          St. Vitus's Day (15th June) by igniting a cart-wheel, which,
          smeared with pitch and plaited with straw, was fastened on a pole
          twelve feet high, the top of the pole being inserted in the nave of
          the wheel. This fire was made on the summit of the mountain, and as
          the flame ascended, the people uttered a set form of words, with
          eyes and arms directed heaven-ward.<a id="noteref_734" name=
          "noteref_734" href="#note_734"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a> Here
          the fact of a wheel being fixed on the top of a pole and ignited
          makes it probable that originally the fire was produced, as in the
          need-fire, by the revolution of a wheel. The day on which the
          ceremony takes place (15th June) is near midsummer; and we have
          seen that in Masuren fire is (or was) actually made on Midsummer
          Day by turning a wheel rapidly about an oaken pole, though it is
          not said that the new fire so produced is used to light a
          bonfire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once more, the
          influence which these bonfires are supposed to exert on the weather
          and on vegetation, goes to show that they are sun-charms, since the
          effects ascribed to them are identical with those of sunshine.
          Thus, in Sweden the warmth or cold of the coming season is inferred
          from the direction in which the flames of the bonfire are blown; if
          they blow to the south, it will be warm, if to the north, cold. No
          doubt at present the direction of the flames is regarded merely as
          an augury of the weather, not as a mode of influencing it. But we
          may be pretty sure that this is one of the cases in which magic has
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name=
          "Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dwindled into
          divination. So in the Eifel Mountains, when the smoke blows towards
          the corn-fields, this is an omen that the harvest will be abundant.
          But doubtless the older view was, not merely that the smoke and
          flames prognosticated, but that they actually produced an abundant
          harvest, the heat of the flames acting like sunshine on the corn.
          Indeed, this older view must still have been held by people in the
          Isle of Man when they lit fires to windward of their fields in
          order that the smoke might blow over them. Again, the idea that the
          corn will grow well as far as the blaze of the bonfire is visible,
          is certainly a remnant of the belief in the quickening and
          fertilising power of the bonfires. The same belief reappears in the
          notion that embers taken from the bonfires and inserted in the
          fields will promote the growth of the crops, and again it plainly
          underlies the custom of mixing the ashes of the bonfire with the
          seed-corn at sowing, or of scattering the ashes by themselves over
          the field. The belief that the flax will grow as high as the people
          leap over the bonfire belongs clearly to the same class of ideas.
          Once more, we saw that at Konz, on the banks of the Moselle, if the
          blazing wheel which was trundled down the hillside reached the
          river without being extinguished, this was hailed as a proof that
          the vintage would be abundant. So firmly was this belief held that
          the successful performance of the ceremony entitled the villagers
          to levy a tax upon the owners of the neighbouring vineyards. Here
          the unextinguished wheel meant an unclouded sun, and this in turn
          meant an abundant vintage. So the waggon-load of white wine which
          the villagers received from the vineyards round about was in fact a
          payment for the sunshine which they had procured for the
          grapes.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg
          272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          interpretation of these fire-customs as charms for making sunshine
          is confirmed by a parallel custom observed by the Hindoos of
          Southern India at the Pongol or Feast of Ingathering. The festival
          is celebrated in the early part of January, when, according to
          Hindoo astrologers, the sun enters the tropic of Capricorn, and the
          chief event of the festival coincides with the passage of the sun.
          For some days previously the boys gather heaps of sticks, straw,
          dead leaves, and everything that will burn. On the morning of the
          first day of the festival the heaps are fired. Every street and
          lane has its bonfire. The young folk leap over the fire or pile on
          fresh fuel. This fire is an offering to Sûrya, the sun-god, or to
          Agni, the deity of fire; it <span class="tei tei-q">“wakes him from
          his sleep, calling on him again to gladden the earth with his light
          and heat.”</span><a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href=
          "#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> To
          say that the fires awaken the sun-god from his sleep is only a
          metaphorical and perhaps modernised expression of the belief that
          they actually help to rekindle the sun's light and heat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
          leaping over the fire and driving cattle through it may be
          intended, on the one hand, to secure for man and beast a share of
          the vital energy of the sun, and, on the other hand, to purify them
          from all evil influences; for to the primitive mind fire is the
          most powerful of all purificatory agents. The latter idea is
          obviously uppermost in the minds of Greek women when they leap over
          the midsummer fire, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I leave my
          sins behind me.”</span> So in Yucatan at a New Year's festival the
          people used to light a huge bonfire and pass through it, in the
          belief that this was a means of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> ridding themselves of their troubles.<a id=
          "noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href="#note_736"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> The
          custom of driving cattle through a fire is not confined to Europe.
          At certain times the Hottentots make a fire of chips, dry branches,
          and green twigs, so as to raise a great smoke. Through this fire
          they drive their sheep, dragging them through by force, if
          necessary. If the sheep make their escape without passing through
          the fire, it is reckoned a heavy disgrace and a very bad omen. But
          if they pass readily through or over the fire, the joy of the
          Hottentots is indescribable.<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737"
          href="#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The procession
          or race with burning torches, which so often forms a part of these
          fire-festivals, appears to be simply a means of diffusing far and
          wide the genial influence of the bonfire or of the sunshine which
          it represents. Hence on these occasions lighted torches are very
          frequently carried over the fields, sometimes with the avowed
          intention of fertilising them;<a id="noteref_738" name=
          "noteref_738" href="#note_738"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">738</span></span></a> and
          with the same intention live coals from the bonfire are sometimes
          placed in the field <span class="tei tei-q">“to prevent
          blight.”</span> The custom of trundling a burning wheel over the
          fields, which is practised for the express purpose of fertilising
          them, embodies the same idea in a still more graphic form; since in
          this way the mock-sun itself, not merely its light and heat
          represented by torches, is made actually to pass over the ground
          which is to receive its quickening and kindly influence. Again, the
          custom of carrying lighted brands round the cattle is plainly
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name=
          "Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> equivalent to
          driving the animals through the fire. It is quite possible that in
          these customs the idea of the quickening power of fire may be
          combined with the conception of it as a purgative agent for the
          expulsion or destruction of evil beings. It is certainly sometimes
          interpreted in the latter way by persons who practise the customs;
          and this purgative use of fire comes out very prominently, as we
          have seen, in the general expulsion of demons from towns and
          villages. But in the present class of cases this aspect of it is
          perhaps secondary, if indeed it is more than a later
          misinterpretation of the custom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It remains to
          ask, What is the meaning of burning an effigy in these bonfires?
          The effigies so burned, as was remarked above, can hardly be
          separated from the effigies of Death which are burned or otherwise
          destroyed in spring; and grounds have been already given for
          regarding the so-called effigies of Death as really representations
          of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. Are the other effigies,
          which are burned in the spring and midsummer bonfires, susceptible
          of the same explanation? It would seem so. For just as the
          fragments of the so-called Death are stuck in the fields to make
          the crops grow, so the charred embers of the figure burned in the
          spring bonfires are sometimes placed in the fields in the belief
          that they will keep vermin from the crop. Again, the rule that the
          last married bride must leap over the fire in which the straw-man
          is burned on Shrove Tuesday, is probably intended to make her
          fruitful. But, as we have seen, the power of blessing women with
          offspring is a special attribute of tree-spirits;<a id=
          "noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href="#note_739"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a> it is
          therefore a fair presumption that the burning <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> effigy over which the bride must leap
          is a representative of the fertilising tree-spirit or spirit of
          vegetation. This character of the effigy, as representative of the
          spirit of vegetation, is almost unmistakable when the effigy is
          composed of an unthreshed sheaf of corn or is covered from head to
          foot with flowers.<a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href=
          "#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a>
          Again, it is to be noted that instead of an effigy living trees are
          sometimes burned both in the spring and midsummer bonfires.<a id=
          "noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a> Now,
          considering the frequency with which the tree-spirit is represented
          in human shape, it is hardly rash to suppose that when sometimes a
          tree and sometimes an effigy is burned in these fires, the effigy
          and the tree are regarded as equivalent to each other, each being a
          representative of the tree-spirit. This, again, is confirmed by
          observing, first, that sometimes the effigy which is to be burned
          is carried about simultaneously with a May-tree, the former being
          carried by the boys, the latter by the girls;<a id="noteref_742"
          name="noteref_742" href="#note_742"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a> and,
          second, that the effigy is sometimes tied to a living tree and
          burned with it.<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href=
          "#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a> In
          these cases, we can scarcely doubt, the tree-spirit is represented,
          as we have found it represented before, in duplicate, both by the
          tree and by the effigy. That the true character of the effigy as a
          representative of the beneficent spirit of vegetation should
          sometimes be forgotten, is natural. The custom of burning a
          beneficent god is too foreign to later modes of thought to escape
          misinterpretation. Naturally enough the people who continued to
          burn his image came in time to identify it as the effigy of
          persons, whom, on various grounds, they considered objectionable,
          such as Judas Iscariot, Luther, and a witch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
          reasons for killing a god or his <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> representative have been examined in the
          preceding chapter. But when the god happens to be a deity of
          vegetation, there are special reasons why he should die by fire.
          For light and heat are necessary to vegetable growth; and, on the
          principle of sympathetic magic, by subjecting the personal
          representative of vegetation to their influence, you secure a
          supply of these necessaries for trees and crops. In other words, by
          burning the spirit of vegetation in a fire which represents the
          sun, you make sure that, for a time at least, vegetation shall have
          plenty of sun. It may be objected that, if the intention is simply
          to secure enough sunshine for vegetation, this end would be better
          attained, on the principles of sympathetic magic, by merely passing
          the representative of vegetation through the fire instead of
          burning him. In point of fact this is sometimes done. In Russia, as
          we have seen, the straw figure of Kupalo is not burned in the
          midsummer fire, but merely carried backwards and forwards across
          it.<a id="noteref_744" name="noteref_744" href=
          "#note_744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a> But,
          for the reasons already given, it is necessary that the god should
          die; so next day Kupalo is stripped of her ornaments and thrown
          into a stream. In this Russian custom, therefore, the passage of
          the image through the fire is a sun-charm pure and simple; the
          killing of the god is a separate act, and the mode of killing
          him—by drowning—is probably a rain-charm. But usually people have
          not thought it necessary to draw this fine distinction; for the
          various reasons already assigned, it is advantageous, they think,
          to expose the god of vegetation to a considerable degree of heat,
          and it is also advantageous to kill him, and they combine these
          advantages in a rough-and-ready way by burning him.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, we have
          to ask, were human beings formerly burned as representatives of the
          tree-spirit or deity of vegetation? We have seen reasons for
          believing that living persons have often acted as representatives
          of the tree-spirit, and have suffered death as such. There is no
          reason, therefore, why they should not have been burned, if any
          special advantages were likely to be attained by putting them to
          death in that way. The consideration of human suffering is not one
          which enters into the calculations of primitive man. It would have
          been surprising if it did, when we remember the record of Christian
          Europe. Now, in the fire-festivals which we are discussing, the
          pretence of burning people is sometimes carried so far that it
          seems reasonable to regard it as a mitigated survival of an older
          custom of actually burning them. Thus in Aachen, as we saw, the man
          clad in peas-straw acts so cleverly that the children really
          believe he is being burned. And at the Beltane fires the pretended
          victim was seized, and a show made of throwing him into the fire,
          and for some time afterwards people affected to speak of him as
          dead. In the following customs Mannhardt is probably right in
          recognising traces of an old custom of burning a leaf-clad
          representative of the spirit of vegetation. At Wolfeck, in Austria,
          on Midsummer Day, a boy completely clad in green fir branches goes
          from house to house, accompanied by a noisy crew, collecting wood
          for the bonfire. As he gets the wood he sings—</p>

          Bavaria, also, the boys who go from house to house collecting fuel

          the children, while the older people retired to a wood. Here they
          encased a young fellow in leaves and twigs, who, thus disguised,
          went to the fire, scattered it, and trod it out. All the people
          present fled at the sight of him.<a id="noteref_747" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it seems
          possible to go farther than this. Of human sacrifices offered on
          these occasions the most unequivocal traces, as we have seen, are
          those which, about a hundred years ago, still lingered at the
          Beltane fires in the Highlands of Scotland, that is, among a Celtic
          people who, situated in a remote corner of Europe, enjoying
          practical independence, and almost completely isolated from foreign
          influence, had till then conserved their old heathenism better than
          any other people in the West of Europe. It is significant,
          therefore, that human sacrifices by fire are known, on
          unquestionable evidence, to have been systematically practised by
          the Celts. The earliest description of these sacrifices is by
          Julius Caesar. As conqueror of the hitherto independent Celts of
          Gaul, Caesar had ample opportunity of observing the national Celtic
          religion and manners, while these were still fresh and crisp from
          the native mint and had not yet been fused in the melting-pot of
          Roman civilisation. With <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg
          279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          his own notes Caesar appears to have incorporated the observations
          of a Greek explorer, by name Posidonius, who travelled in Gaul
          about fifty years before Caesar carried the Roman arms to the
          English Channel. The Greek geographer Strabo and the historian
          Diodorus seem also to have derived their descriptions of the Celtic
          sacrifices from the work of Posidonius, but independently of each
          other and of Caesar, for each of the three derivative accounts
          contains some details which are not to be found in either of the
          others. By combining them, therefore, we can restore the original
          account of Posidonius with some certainty, and thus obtain a
          picture of the sacrifices offered by the Celts of Gaul at the close
          of the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span><a id="noteref_748"

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">748</span></span></a> The
          following seem to have been the main outlines of the custom.
          Condemned criminals were reserved by the Celts in order to be
          sacrificed to the gods at a great festival which took place once in
          every five years. The more there were of such victims, the greater
          was believed to be the fertility of the land.<a id="noteref_749"
          name="noteref_749" href="#note_749"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a> When
          there were not enough criminals to furnish victims, captives taken
          in war were sacrificed to supply the deficiency. When the time came
          the victims were sacrificed by the Druids or priests. Some were
          shot down with arrows, some were impaled, and some were burned
          alive in the following manner. Colossal images of wicker-work or of
          wood and grass were constructed; these were filled with live men,
          cattle, and animals of other kinds; fire was then applied to the
          images, and they were burned with their living
          contents.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg
          280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were the
          great festivals held once every five years. But besides these
          quinquennial festivals, celebrated on so grand a scale and with,
          apparently, so large an expenditure of human life, it seems
          reasonable to suppose that festivals of the same sort, only on a
          lesser scale, were held annually, and that from these annual
          festivals are lineally descended some at least of the
          fire-festivals which, with their traces of human sacrifices, are
          still celebrated year by year in many parts of Europe. The gigantic
          images constructed of osiers or covered with grass in which the
          Druids enclosed their victims remind us of the leafy framework in
          which the human representative of the tree-spirit is still so often
          encased.<a id="noteref_750" name="noteref_750" href=
          "#note_750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Considering, therefore, that the fertility of the land was
          apparently supposed to depend upon the due performance of these
          sacrifices, Mannhardt is probably right in viewing the Celtic
          victims, cased in osiers and grass, as representatives of the
          tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. These wicker giants of the
          Druids seem to have still their representatives at the spring and
          midsummer festivals of modern Europe. At Douay a procession takes
          place annually on the Sunday nearest to the 7th of July. The great
          feature of the procession is a colossal figure made of osiers, and
          called <span class="tei tei-q">“the giant,”</span> which is moved
          through the streets by means of rollers and ropes worked by men who
          are enclosed within the figure. The wooden head of the giant is
          said to have been carved and painted by Rubens. The figure is armed
          as a knight with lance and sword, helmet and shield. Behind him
          march his wife and his three children, all constructed of osiers on
          the same principle, but on a smaller scale.<a id="noteref_751"
          name="noteref_751" href="#note_751"><span class=

          and canvas, properly painted and dressed. It contains a great many
          living men within it, who move it about. Wicker giants of this sort
          are common in the towns of Belgium and French Flanders; they are
          led about at the Carnival in spring. The people, it is said, are
          much attached to these grotesque figures, speak of them with
          patriotic enthusiasm, and never weary of gazing at them.<a id=

          England artificial giants seem to have been a standing feature of
          the midsummer festival. A writer of the sixteenth century speaks of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Midsommer pageants in London, where, to
          make the people wonder, are set forth great and uglie gyants,
          marching as if they were alive, and armed at all points, but within
          they are stuffed full of browne paper and tow, which the shrewd
          boyes, underpeeping, do guilefully discover, and turne to a greate
          derision.”</span><a id="noteref_753" name="noteref_753" href=

          these cases the giants only figure in the processions. But
          sometimes they are burned in the spring or summer bonfires. Thus
          the people of the Rue aux Ours in Paris used annually to make a
          great wicker-work figure, dressed as a soldier, which they
          promenaded up and down the streets for several days, and solemnly
          burned on the 3d of July, the crowd of spectators singing
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Salve Regina</span></span>. The burning
          fragments of the image were scattered among the people, who eagerly
          scrambled for them. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          Druidical custom of burning live animals, enclosed in wicker-work,
          has its counterpart at the spring and midsummer festivals. At
          Luchon in the Pyrenees on Midsummer Eve <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          hollow column, composed of strong wicker-work, is raised to the
          height of about sixty feet in the centre of the principal suburb,
          and interlaced with green foliage up to the very top; while the
          most beautiful flowers and shrubs procurable are artistically
          arranged in groups below, so as to form a sort of background to the
          scene. The column is then filled with combustible materials, ready
          for ignition. At an appointed hour—about 8 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          composed of the clergy, followed by young men and maidens in
          holiday attire, pour forth from the town chanting hymns, and take
          up their position around the column. Meanwhile, bonfires are lit,
          with beautiful effect, in the surrounding hills. As many living
          serpents as could be collected are now thrown into the column,
          which is set on fire at the base by means of torches, armed with
          which about fifty boys and men dance around with frantic gestures.
          The serpents, to avoid the flames, wriggle their way to the top,
          whence they are seen lashing out laterally until finally obliged to
          drop, their struggles for life giving rise to enthusiastic delight
          among the surrounding spectators. This is a favourite annual
          ceremony for the inhabitants of Luchon and its neighbourhood, and
          local tradition assigns to it a heathen origin.”</span><a id=

          fires formerly kindled on the Place de Grève at Paris it was the
          custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats;
          sometimes a fox was burned. The people collected the embers and

          Sometimes animals are burned in the spring bonfires. In the Vosges
          cats were burned on Shrove Tuesday; in Elsass they were thrown into
          the Easter bonfire.<a id="noteref_762" name="noteref_762" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the men who
          were burned in wicker frames by the Druids represented the spirit
          of vegetation, the animals burned along with them must have had the
          same meaning. Amongst the animals burned by the Druids or in modern
          bonfires have been, as we saw, cattle, cats, foxes, and cocks; and
          all of these creatures are variously regarded by European peoples
          as embodiments of the corn-spirit.<a id="noteref_763" name=
          "noteref_763" href="#note_763"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">763</span></span></a> I am
          not aware of any certain evidence that in Europe serpents have been
          regarded as representatives of the tree-spirit or

          "#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          victims at the midsummer festival in Luchon they may <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have replaced animals which really had
          this representative character. When the meaning of the custom was
          forgotten, utility and humanity might unite in suggesting the
          substitution of noxious reptiles as victims in room of harmless and
          useful animals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that the sacrificial rites of the Celts of ancient Gaul can be
          traced in the popular festivals of modern Europe. Naturally it is
          in France, or rather in the wider area comprised within the limits
          of ancient Gaul, that these rites have left the clearest traces in
          the customs of burning giants of wicker-work and animals enclosed
          in wicker-work or baskets. These customs, it will have been
          remarked, are generally observed at or about midsummer. From this
          we may infer that the original rites of which these are the
          degenerate successors were solemnised at midsummer. This inference
          harmonises with the conclusion suggested by a general survey of
          European folk-custom, that the midsummer festival must on the whole
          have been the most widely diffused and the most solemn of all the
          yearly festivals celebrated by the primitive Aryans in Europe. And
          in its application to the Celts this general conclusion is
          corroborated by the more or less perfect vestiges of midsummer
          fire-festivals which we have found lingering in all those
          westernmost promontories and islands which are the last strongholds
          of the Celtic race in Europe—Britanny, Cornwall, Wales, the Isle of
          Man, Scotland, and Ireland. In Scotland, it is true, the chief
          Celtic fire-festivals certainly appear to have been held at Beltane
          (1st May) and Hallow E'en; but this was exceptional.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To sum up: the
          combined evidence of ancient writers and of modern folk-custom
          points to the conclusion that amongst the Celts of Gaul an annual
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name=
          "Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> festival was
          celebrated at midsummer, at which living men, representing the
          tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation, were enclosed in wicker-frames
          and burned. The whole rite was designed as a charm to make the sun
          to shine and the crops to grow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But another
          great feature of the Celtic midsummer festival appears to have been
          the gathering of the sacred mistletoe by the Druids. The ceremony
          has been thus described by Pliny in a passage which has often been
          quoted. After enumerating the different kinds of mistletoe he
          proceeds: <span class="tei tei-q">“In treating of this subject, the
          admiration in which the mistletoe is held throughout Gaul ought not
          to pass unnoticed. The Druids, for so they call their wizards,
          esteem nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the tree on which
          it grows, provided only that the tree is an oak. But apart from
          this they choose oak-woods for their sacred groves and perform no
          sacred rites without oak-leaves; so that the very name of Druids
          may be regarded as a Greek appellation derived from their worship
          of the oak.<a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href=
          "#note_765"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a> For
          they believe that whatever grows on these trees is sent from
          heaven, and is a sign that the tree has been chosen by the god
          himself. The mistletoe is very rarely to be met with; but when it
          is found, they gather it with solemn ceremony. This they do
          especially in the sixth month (the beginnings of their months and
          years are determined by the moon) and after the tree has passed the
          thirtieth year of its age, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> because by that time it has plenty of vigour,
          though it has not attained half its full size. After due
          preparations have been made for a sacrifice and a feast under the
          tree, they hail it as the universal healer and bring to the spot
          two white bulls, whose horns have never been bound before. A priest
          clad in a white robe climbs the tree and with a golden<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">766</span></span></a>
          sickle cuts the mistletoe, which is caught in a white cloth. Then
          they sacrifice the victims, praying that God may make his own gift
          to prosper with those upon whom he has bestowed it. They believe
          that a potion prepared from mistletoe will make barren animals to
          bring forth, and that the plant is a remedy against all
          poison.”</span><a id="noteref_767" name="noteref_767" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In saying that
          the Druids cut the mistletoe in the sixth month Pliny must have had
          in his mind the Roman calendar, in which the sixth month was June.
          Now, if the cutting of the mistletoe took place in June, we may be
          almost certain that the day which witnessed the ceremony was
          Midsummer Eve. For in many places Midsummer Eve, a day redolent of
          a thousand decaying fancies of yore, is still the time for culling
          certain magic plants, whose evanescent virtue can be secured at
          this mystic season alone. For example, on Midsummer Eve the fern is
          believed to burst into a wondrous bloom, like fire or burnished
          gold. Whoever <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg
          287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          catches this bloom, which very quickly fades and falls off, can
          make himself invisible, can understand the language of animals, and
          so forth. But he must not touch it with his hand; he must spread a
          white cloth under the fern, and the magic bloom (or seed) will fall
          into it.<a id="noteref_768" name="noteref_768" href=

          kinds of wounds and to drive away witches and demons, is gathered

          provided it be gathered on St. John's Eve. Hence in France it is
          called the herb of St. John. People weave themselves a girdle of
          the plant, believing that it will protect them against ghosts,
          magic, misfortune, and disease, throughout the year. Or they weave
          garlands of it on St. John's Eve, and look through them at the
          midsummer bonfire or put them on their heads. Whoever does this
          will suffer no aches in his eyes or head that year. Sometimes the
          plant is thrown into the midsummer bonfire.<a id="noteref_770"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These facts by
          themselves would suffice to raise a strong presumption that, if the
          Druids cut the mistletoe in June, as we learn from Pliny that they
          did, the day on which they cut it could have been no other than
          Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day. This presumption is converted into
          practical certainty when we find it to be still a rule of folk-lore
          that the mistletoe should be cut on Midsummer Eve.<a id=

          Further, the peasants of Piedmont and Lombardy still go out on

          Originally no doubt the <span class="tei tei-q">“oil of St.

          can be nothing but a survival of the name by which, as we have

          mistletoe.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that the two main features of the Balder myth—the pulling of the
          mistletoe and the burning of the god—were reproduced in the great
          midsummer festival of the Celts. But in Scandinavia itself, the
          home of Balder, both these features of his myth can still be traced
          in the popular celebration of midsummer. For in Sweden on Midsummer
          Eve mistletoe is <span class="tei tei-q">“diligently sought after,
          they believing it to be, in a high degree, possessed of mystic
          qualities; and that if a sprig of it be attached to the ceiling of

          in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark huge bonfires are kindled on hills
          and eminences on Midsummer Eve.<a id="noteref_781" name=

          does not appear, indeed, that any effigy is burned in these
          bonfires; but the burning of an effigy is a feature which might
          easily drop out after its meaning was forgotten. And the name of
          Balder's bale-fires (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Balder's Bălar</span></span>), by which these
          midsummer fires were formerly known in Sweden,<a id="noteref_782"
          name="noteref_782" href="#note_782"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a> puts
          their connection with Balder beyond the reach of doubt, and makes
          it certain that in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg
          290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          former times either a living representative or an effigy of Balder
          must have been annually burned in them. Midsummer was the season
          sacred to Balder, and the fact that the Swedish poet Tegner, in his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Frithiofssaga</span></span>, places the
          burning of Balder at midsummer<a id="noteref_783" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a> may
          perhaps be allowed as evidence of a Swedish tradition to that
          effect. From this double coincidence of the Balder myth, on the one
          hand with the midsummer festival of Celtic Gaul and on the other
          with the midsummer festival in Scandinavia, we may safely conclude
          that the myth is not a myth pure and simple, that is, a mere
          description of physical phenomena in imagery borrowed from human
          life; it must undoubtedly be a ritualistic myth, that is a myth
          based on actual observation of religious ceremonies and purporting
          to explain them. Now, the standing explanation which myth gives of
          ritual is that the ritual in question is a periodic commemoration
          of some remarkable transaction in the past, the actors in which may
          have been either gods or men. Such an explanation the Balder myth
          would seem to offer of the annual fire-festivals which, as we saw,
          must have played so prominent a part in the primitive religion of
          the Aryan race in Europe. Balder must have been the Norse
          representative of the being who was burnt in effigy or in the
          person of a living man at the fire-festivals in question. But if,
          as I have tried to show, the being so burnt was the tree-spirit or
          spirit of vegetation, it follows that Balder also must have been a
          tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is
          desirable to determine, if we can, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> particular kind of tree or trees, of which a
          personal representative was burned at the fire-festivals. For we
          may be quite sure that it was not as a representative of vegetation
          in general that the victim suffered death. The conception of
          vegetation in general is too abstract to be primitive. Most
          probably the victim at first represented a particular kind of
          sacred tree. Now of all European trees none has such claims as the
          oak to be considered as pre-eminently the sacred tree of the
          Aryans. Its worship is attested for all the great branches of the
          Aryan stock in Europe. We have seen that it was not only the sacred
          tree, but the principal object of worship of both Celts and
          Slavs.<a id="noteref_784" name="noteref_784" href=

          According to Grimm, the oak ranked first among the holy trees of
          the Germans, and was indeed their chief god. It is certainly known
          to have been adored by them in the age of heathendom, and traces of
          its worship have survived in various parts of Germany almost to the
          present day.<a id="noteref_785" name="noteref_785" href=

          Amongst the ancient Italians, according to Preller, the oak was

          Dodona, perhaps the oldest of all Greek sanctuaries, Zeus was
          worshipped as immanent in the sacred oak, and the rustling of its

          then, the great god of both Greeks and Romans was represented in
          some of his oldest shrines under the form of an oak, and if the oak
          was the principal object of worship of Celts, Germans, and Slavs,
          we may <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg
          292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          certainly conclude that this tree was one of the chief, if not the
          very chief divinity of the Aryans before the dispersion; and that
          their primitive home must have lain in a land which was clothed
          with forests of oak.<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href=
          "#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, considering
          the primitive character and remarkable similarity of the
          fire-festivals observed by all the branches of the Aryan race in
          Europe, we may infer that these festivals form part of the common
          stock of religious observances which the various peoples carried
          with them in their wanderings from their original home. But, if I
          am right, an essential feature of those primitive fire-festivals
          was the burning of a man who represented the tree-spirit. In view,
          then, of the place occupied by the oak in the religion of the
          Aryans, the presumption is that the tree so represented at the
          fire-festivals must originally have been the oak. So far as the
          Celts and Slavs are concerned, this conclusion will perhaps hardly
          be contested. But both for them and for the Germans it is confirmed
          by a remarkable piece of religious conservatism. The most primitive
          method known to man of producing fire is by rubbing two pieces of
          wood against each other till they ignite; and we have seen that
          this method is still used in Europe for kindling sacred fires such
          as the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg
          293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          need-fire, and that most probably it was formerly resorted to at
          all the fire-festivals under discussion. Now it is sometimes
          prescribed that the need-fire, or other sacred fire, must be made
          by the friction of a particular kind of wood; and wherever the kind
          of wood is prescribed, whether among Celts, Germans, or Slavs, that
          wood is always the oak. Thus we have seen that amongst the Slavs of
          Masuren the new fire for the village is made on Midsummer Day by
          causing a wheel to revolve rapidly round an axle of oak till the
          axle takes fire.<a id="noteref_790" name="noteref_790" href=
          "#note_790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a> When
          the perpetual fire which the ancient Slavs used to maintain chanced
          to go out, it was rekindled by the friction of a piece of oak-wood,
          which had been previously heated by being struck with a gray (not a
          red) stone.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href=
          "#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Germany the need-fire was regularly kindled by the friction of
          oak-wood;<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href=
          "#note_792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          in the Highlands of Scotland, both the Beltane and the need-fires
          were lighted by similar means.<a id="noteref_793" name=

          if the sacred fire was regularly kindled by the friction of
          oak-wood, we may infer that originally the fire was also fed with
          the same material. In point of fact, the perpetual fire which
          burned under the sacred oak at the great Slavonian sanctuary of
          Romove was fed with oak-wood;<a id="noteref_794" name="noteref_794"
          href="#note_794"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">794</span></span></a> and
          that oak-wood was formerly the fuel <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> burned in the midsummer fires may perhaps be
          inferred from the circumstance that in many mountain districts of
          Germany peasants are still in the habit of making up their cottage
          fire on Midsummer Day with a heavy block of oak-wood. The block is
          so arranged that it smoulders slowly and is not finally reduced to
          charcoal till the expiry of a year. Then upon next Midsummer Day
          the charred embers of the old log are removed to make room for the
          new one, and are mixed with the seed-corn or scattered about the
          garden. This is believed to promote the growth of the crops and to
          preserve them from blight and vermin.<a id="noteref_795" name=
          "noteref_795" href="#note_795"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">795</span></span></a> It
          may be remembered that at the Boeotian festival of the Daedala, the
          analogy of which to the spring and midsummer festivals of modern
          Europe has been already pointed out, the great feature was the
          felling and burning of an oak.<a id="noteref_796" name=
          "noteref_796" href="#note_796"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">796</span></span></a> The
          general conclusion is, that at those periodic or occasional
          ceremonies, of which the object was to cause the sun to shine, and
          the fruits of the earth to grow, the ancient Aryans both kindled
          and fed the fire with the sacred oak-wood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if at these
          solemn rites the fire was regularly made of oak-wood, it follows
          that the man who was burned in it as a personification of the
          tree-spirit could have represented no tree but the oak. The sacred
          oak was thus burned in duplicate; the wood of the tree was consumed
          in the fire, and along with it was consumed a living man as a
          personification of the oak-spirit. The conclusion thus drawn for
          the European Aryans in general is confirmed in its special
          application to the Celts and Scandinavians by the relation in
          which, amongst these peoples, the mistletoe stood to the burning of
          the victim in the midsummer fire. We have <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> seen that among Celts and Scandinavians it
          has been customary to gather the mistletoe at midsummer. But so far
          as appears on the face of this custom, there is nothing to connect
          it with the midsummer fires in which human victims or effigies of
          them were burned. Even if the fire, as seems probable, was
          originally always made with oak-wood, why should it have been
          necessary to pull the mistletoe? The last link between the
          midsummer customs of gathering the mistletoe and lighting the
          bonfires is supplied by Balder's myth, which certainly cannot be
          disjoined from the customs in question. The myth shows that a vital
          connection must once have been believed to subsist between the
          mistletoe and the human representative of the oak who was burned in
          the fire. According to the myth, Balder could be killed by nothing
          in heaven or earth except the mistletoe; and so long as the
          mistletoe remained on the oak, he was not only immortal, but
          invulnerable. Now, as soon as we see that Balder was the oak, the
          origin of the myth becomes plain. The mistletoe was viewed as the
          seat of life of the oak, and so long as it was uninjured nothing
          could kill or even wound the oak. The conception of the mistletoe
          as the seat of life of the oak would naturally be suggested to
          primitive people by the observation that while the oak is
          deciduous, the mistletoe which grows on it is evergreen. In winter
          the sight of its fresh foliage among the bare branches must have
          been hailed by the worshippers of the tree as a sign that the
          divine life which had ceased to animate the branches yet survived
          in the mistletoe, as the heart of a sleeper still beats when his
          body is motionless. Hence when the god had to be killed—when the
          sacred tree had to be burnt—it was necessary to begin by breaking
          off <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name=
          "Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the mistletoe. For
          so long as the mistletoe remained intact, the oak (so people
          thought) was invulnerable; all the blows of their knives and axes
          would glance harmless from its surface. But once tear from the oak
          its sacred heart—the mistletoe—and the tree nodded to its fall. And
          when in later times the spirit of the oak came to be represented by
          a living man, it was logically necessary to suppose that, like the
          tree he personated, he could neither be killed nor wounded so long
          as the mistletoe remained uninjured. The pulling of the mistletoe
          was thus at once the signal and the cause of his death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But since the
          idea of a being whose life is thus, in a sense, outside itself,
          must be strange to many readers, and has, indeed, not yet been
          recognised in its full bearing on primitive superstition, it will
          be worth while to devote a couple of sections to the subject. The
          result will be to show that, in assuming this idea as the
          explanation of the relation of Balder to the mistletoe, I assume a
          principle which is deeply engraved on the mind of primitive
          man.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">§ 3.—The external soul in
          folk-tales.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a former
          chapter we saw that, in the opinion of primitive people, the soul
          may temporarily absent itself from the body without causing death.
          Such temporary absences of the soul are often believed to involve
          considerable risk, since the wandering soul is liable to a variety
          of mishaps at the hands of enemies, and so forth. But there is
          another aspect to this power of externalising the soul. If only the
          safety of the soul can be ensured during its absence from the body,
          there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name=
          "Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is no reason why the
          soul should not continue absent for an indefinite time; indeed a
          man may, on a pure calculation of personal safety, desire that his
          soul should never return to his body. Unable to conceive of life
          abstractly as a <span class="tei tei-q">“permanent possibility of
          sensation”</span> or a <span class="tei tei-q">“continuous
          adjustment of internal arrangements to external relations,”</span>
          the savage thinks of it as a concrete material thing of a definite
          bulk, capable of being seen and handled, kept in a box or jar, and
          liable to be bruised, fractured, or smashed in pieces. It is not
          needful that the life, so conceived, should be in the man; it may
          be absent from his body and still continue to animate him, by
          virtue of a sort of sympathy or <span class="tei tei-q">“action at
          a distance.”</span> So long as this object which he calls his life
          or soul remains unharmed, the man is well; if it is injured, he
          suffers; if it is destroyed, he dies. Or, to put it otherwise, when
          a man is ill or dies, the fact is explained by saying that the
          material object called his life or soul, whether it be in his body
          or out of it, has either sustained injury or been destroyed. But
          there may be circumstances in which, if the life or soul remains in
          the man, it stands a greater chance of sustaining injury than if it
          were stowed away in some safe and secret place. Accordingly, in
          such circumstances, primitive man takes his soul out of his body
          and deposits it for security in some safe place, intending to
          replace it in his body when the danger is past. Or if he should
          discover some place of absolute security, he may be content to
          leave his soul there permanently. The advantage of this is that, so
          long as the soul remains unharmed in the place where he has
          deposited it, the man himself is immortal; nothing can kill his
          body, since his life is not in it.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Evidence of this
          primitive belief is furnished by a class of folk-tales of which the
          Norse story of <span class="tei tei-q">“The giant who had no heart
          in his body”</span> is perhaps the best-known example. Stories of
          this kind are widely diffused over the world, and from their number
          and the variety of incident and of details in which the leading
          idea is embodied, we may infer that the conception of an external
          soul is one which has had a powerful hold on the minds of men at an
          early stage of history. For folk-tales are a faithful reflection of
          the world as it appeared to the primitive mind; and we may be sure
          that any idea which commonly occurs in them, however absurd it may
          seem to us, must once have been an ordinary article of belief. This
          assurance, so far as it concerns the supposed power of
          externalising the soul for a longer or shorter time, is amply
          corroborated by a comparison of the folk-tales in question with the
          actual beliefs and practices of savages. To this we shall return
          after some specimens of the tales have been given. The specimens
          will be selected with a view of illustrating both the
          characteristic features and the wide diffusion of this class of
          tales.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
          place, the story of the external soul is told, in various forms, by
          all Aryan peoples from Hindustan to the Hebrides. A very common
          form of it is this: A warlock, giant, or other fairyland being is
          invulnerable and immortal because he keeps his soul hidden far away
          in some secret place; but a fair princess, whom he holds enthralled
          in his enchanted castle, wiles his secret from him and reveals it
          to the hero, who seeks out the warlock's soul, heart, life, or
          death (as it is variously called), and, by destroying it,
          simultaneously kills the warlock. Thus a Hindoo story tells how a
          magician called Punchkin held a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> queen captive for twelve years, and would
          fain marry her, but she would not have him. At last the queen's son
          came to rescue her, and the two plotted together to kill Punchkin.
          So the queen spoke the magician fair, and pretended that she had at
          last made up her mind to marry him. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘And do tell me,’</span> she
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘are you quite immortal? Can death
          never touch you? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel
          human suffering?’</span> ... <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is
          true,’</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘that I am not as
          others. Far, far away—hundreds of thousands of miles from
          this—there lies a desolate country covered with thick jungle. In
          the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm-trees, and in the
          centre of the circle stand six chattees full of water, piled one
          above another; below the sixth chattee is a small cage, which
          contains a little green parrot—on the life of the parrot depends my
          life—and if the parrot is killed I must die. It is,
          however,’</span> he added, <span class="tei tei-q">‘impossible that
          the parrot should sustain any injury, both on account of the
          inaccessibility of the country, and because, by my appointment,

          overcame all difficulties, and got possession of the parrot. He
          brought it to the door of the magician's palace, and began playing
          with it. Punchkin, the magician, saw him, and, coming out, tried to

          one of his wings; and as he did so the magician's right arm fell
          off. Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, <span class=

          parrot's second wing, and the magician's left arm tumbled off.

          fell off; the prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell
          the magician's left. Nothing remained of him except the lifeless
          body and the head; but still he rolled his eyes, and cried,

          with that he wrung the bird's neck, and threw it at the magician;

          another Breton tale a giant is called Body-without-Soul because his
          life does not reside in his body. It resides in an egg, the egg is
          in a dove, the dove is in a hare, the hare is in a wolf, and the
          wolf is in an iron chest at the bottom of the sea. The hero kills
          the animals one after another, and at the death of each animal the
          giant grows weaker, as if he had lost a limb. When at last the hero
          comes to the giant's castle bearing the egg in his hand, he finds
          Body-without-Soul stretched on his bed at the point of death. So he
          dashes the egg against the giant's forehead, the egg breaks, and
          the giant straightway dies.<a id="noteref_841" name="noteref_841"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The notion of an
          external soul has now been traced in folk-tales told by Aryan
          peoples from India to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg

          Brittany and the Hebrides. We have still to show that the same idea
          occurs commonly in the popular stories of non-Aryan peoples. In the
          first place it appears in the ancient Egyptian story of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Two Brothers.”</span> This story was
          written down in the reign of Rameses II, about 1300 years
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> It is therefore older
          than our present redaction of Homer, and far older than the Bible.
          The outline of the story, so far as it concerns us here, is as
          follows: Once upon a time there were two brethren; the name of the
          elder was Anupu and the name of the younger was Bitiu. Now Anupu
          had a house and a wife, and his younger brother dwelt with him as
          his servant. It was Anupu who made the garments, and every morning
          when it grew light he drove the kine afield. As he walked behind
          them they used to say to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“The grass is
          good in such and such a place,”</span> and he heard what they said
          and led them to the good pasture that they desired. So his kine
          grew very sleek and multiplied greatly. One day when the two
          brothers were at work in the field the elder brother said to the
          younger, <span class="tei tei-q">“Run and fetch seed from the
          village.”</span> So the younger brother ran and said to the wife of
          his elder brother, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me seed that I may
          run to the field, for my brother sent me saying, tarry not.”</span>
          She said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go to the barn and take as much
          as you desire.”</span> He went and filled a jar full of wheat and
          barley, and came forth bearing it on his shoulders. When the woman
          saw him her heart went out to him, and she laid hold of him and
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, let us rest an hour
          together.”</span> But he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art to
          me as a mother, and my brother is to me as a father.”</span> So he
          would not hearken to her, but took the load on his back and went
          away to the field. In the evening, when the elder brother was
          returning from the field, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg
          316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          his wife feared for what she had said. So she took soot and made
          herself as one who has been beaten. And when her husband came home,
          she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“When thy younger brother came to
          fetch seed, he said to me, Come, let us rest an hour together. But
          I would not, and he beat me.”</span> Then the elder brother became
          like a panther of the south; he sharpened his knife and stood
          behind the door of the cow-house. And when the sun set and the
          younger brother came laden with all the herbs of the field, as was
          his wont every day, the cow that walked in front of the herd said
          to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, thy elder brother stands
          with a knife to kill thee. Flee before him.”</span> When he heard
          what the cow said, he looked under the door of the cow-house and
          saw the feet of his elder brother standing behind the door, his
          knife in his hand. So he fled and his brother pursued him with the
          knife. But the younger brother cried for help to the Sun, and the
          Sun heard him and caused a great water to spring up between him and
          his elder brother, and the water was full of crocodiles. The two
          brothers stood, the one on the one side of the water and the other
          on the other, and the younger brother told the elder brother all
          that had befallen. So the elder brother repented him of what he had
          done and he wept aloud. But he could not come at the farther bank
          by reason of the crocodiles. His younger brother called to him and
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go home and tend the cattle thyself.
          For I will dwell no more in the place where thou art. I will go to
          the Valley of the Acacia. But this is what thou shalt do for me.
          Thou shalt come and care for me, if evil befalls me, for I will
          enchant my heart and place it on the top of the flower of the
          Acacia; and if they cut the Acacia and my heart falls to the
          ground, thou shalt come and seek <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class=

          lay it in a vessel of fresh water. Then I shall come to life again.
          But this is the sign that evil has befallen me; the pot of beer in
          thine hand shall bubble.”</span> So he went away to the Valley of
          the Acacia, but his brother returned home with dust on his head and
          slew his wife and cast her to the dogs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For many days
          afterwards the younger brother dwelt alone in the Valley of the
          Acacia. By day he hunted the beasts of the field, but at evening he
          came and laid him down under the Acacia, on the top of whose flower
          was his heart. And many days after that he built himself a house in
          the Valley of the Acacia. But the gods were grieved for him; and
          the Sun said to Khnum, <span class="tei tei-q">“Make a wife for
          Bitiu, that he may not dwell alone.”</span> So Khnum made him a
          woman to dwell with him, who was perfect in her limbs more than any
          woman on earth, for all the gods were in her. So she dwelt with
          him. But one day a lock of her hair fell into the river and floated
          down to the land of Egypt, to the house of Pharaoh's washerwomen.
          The fragrance of the lock perfumed Pharaoh's raiment, and the
          washerwomen were blamed, for it was said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“An odour of perfume in the garments of
          Pharaoh!”</span> So the heart of Pharaoh's chief washerman was
          weary of the complaints that were made every day, and he went to
          the quay, and there in the water he saw the lock of hair. He sent
          one down into the river to fetch it, and, because it smelt sweetly,
          he took it to Pharaoh. Then Pharaoh's magicians were sent for and
          they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“This lock of hair belongs to a
          daughter of the Sun, who has in her the essence of all the gods.
          Let messengers go forth to all foreign lands to seek her.”</span>
          So the woman was brought from the Valley of the Acacia with
          chariots <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg
          318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and archers and much company, and all the land of Egypt rejoiced at
          her coming, and Pharaoh loved her. But when they asked her of her
          husband, she said to Pharaoh, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let them cut
          down the Acacia and let them destroy him.”</span> So men were sent
          with tools to cut down the Acacia. They came to it and cut the
          flower upon which was the heart of Bitiu; and he fell down dead in
          that evil hour. But the next day, when the elder brother of Bitiu
          was entered into his house and had sat down, they brought him a pot
          of beer and it bubbled, and they gave him a jug of wine and it grew
          turbid. Then he took his staff and his sandals and hied him to the
          Valley of the Acacia, and there he found his younger brother lying
          dead in his house. So he sought for the heart of his brother under
          the Acacia. For three years he sought in vain, but in the fourth
          year he found it in the berry of the Acacia. So he threw the heart
          into a cup of fresh water. And when it was night and the heart had
          sucked in much water, Bitiu shook in all his limbs and revived.
          Then he drank the cup of water in which his heart was, and his
          heart went into its place, and he lived as before.<a id=

          hated him and compassed his death. So she sent him on an errand to
          the house of her kinsfolk the ogres. In the house of the ogres he
          saw some things hanging from the roof, and on asking a female slave
          what they were, she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“That is the
          bottle which contains the life of my lady the queen, and the other
          bottle beside it contains the eyes of the queens whom my mistress

          down the two bottles and carried them home to his father's palace.
          There he presented himself before the ogress queen and said,

          Another Tartar poem describes how the hero Kartaga grappled with

          they wrestled; years came and went, and still the struggle went on.
          But the piebald horse and the black horse knew that the

          the seas meet and form one, the sea comes to the surface of the
          earth. At the mouth of the nine seas rises a rock of copper; it
          rises to the surface of the ground, it rises up between heaven and
          earth, this rock of copper. At the foot of the copper rock is a
          black chest, in the black chest is a golden casket, and in the
          golden casket is the soul of the Swan-woman. Seven little birds are
          the soul of the Swan-woman; if the birds are killed the Swan-woman
          will die straightway. So the horses ran to the foot of the copper
          rock, opened the black chest, and brought back the golden casket.
          Then the piebald horse turned himself into a bald-headed man,
          opened the golden casket, and cut off the heads of the seven birds.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Malay poem
          relates how once upon a time in the city of Indrapoera there was a
          certain merchant who was rich and prosperous, but he had no
          children. One day as he walked with his wife by the river they
          found a baby girl, fair as an angel. So they adopted the child and
          called her Bidasari. The merchant caused a golden fish to be made,
          and into this fish he transferred the soul of his adopted daughter.
          Then he put the golden fish in a golden box full of water, and hid
          it in a pond in the midst of his garden. In time the girl grew to
          be a lovely woman. Now the King of Indrapoera had a fair young
          queen, who lived in fear that the king might take to himself a
          second wife. So, hearing of the charms of Bidasari, the queen
          resolved to put her out of the way. So she lured the girl to the
          palace and tortured her cruelly; but Bidasari could not die,
          because her soul was not in her. At last she could stand the
          torture no longer and said to the queen, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If you wish me to die, you must bring the box which is
          in the pond in my father's garden.”</span> So the box was brought
          and opened, and there was the golden fish in the water. The girl
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“My soul is in that fish. In the
          morning you must take the fish out of the water, and in the evening
          you must put it back into the water. Do not let the fish lie about,
          but bind it round your neck. If you do this, I shall soon
          die.”</span> So the queen took the fish out of the box and fastened
          it round her neck; and no sooner had she done so, than Bidasari
          fell into a swoon. But in the evening, when the fish was put back
          into the water, Bidasari came to herself again. Seeing that she
          thus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name=
          "Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had the girl in her
          power, the queen sent her home to her adopted parents. To save her
          from further persecution her parents resolved to remove their
          daughter from the city. So in a lonely and desolate spot they built
          a house and brought Bidasari thither. Here she dwelt alone,
          undergoing vicissitudes that corresponded with the vicissitudes of
          the golden fish in which was her soul. All day long, while the fish
          was out of the water, she remained unconscious; but in the evening,
          when the fish was put into the water, she revived. One day the king
          was out hunting, and coming to the house where Bidasari lay
          unconscious, was smitten with her beauty. He tried to waken her,
          but in vain. Next day, towards evening, he repeated his visit, but
          still found her unconscious. However, when darkness fell, she came
          to herself and told the king the secret of her life. So the king
          returned to the palace, took the fish from the queen, and put it in
          water. Immediately Bidasari revived, and the king took her to
          wife.<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href=

          to the west of Sumatra, which we have visited more than once in the

          enemies, who tried to put him to death but failed. Water would not
          drown him nor fire burn him nor steel pierce him. At last his wife
          revealed the secret. On his head he had a hair as hard as a copper
          wire; and with this wire his life was bound up. So the hair was

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the idea
          that the soul may be deposited for a longer or shorter time in some
          place of security outside the body, or at all events in the hair,
          is found in the popular tales of many races. It remains to show
          that the idea is not a mere figment devised to adorn a tale, but is
          a real article of primitive faith, which has given rise to a
          corresponding set of customs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that in the tales the hero, as a preparation for battle, sometimes
          removes his soul from his body, in order that his body may be
          invulnerable and immortal in the combat. With a like intention the
          savage removes his soul from his body on various occasions of real
          or imaginary danger. Thus we have seen that among the Minahassa of
          Celebes, when a family moves into a new house, a priest collects
          the souls of the whole family in a bag, and afterwards restores
          them to their owners, because the moment of entering a new house is
          supposed to be fraught with supernatural danger.<a id="noteref_860"

          in his house till the confinement is over, when he gives it back,
          receiving a fixed sum of money for doing so. The piece of iron
          represents the woman's soul, which at this critical time is
          believed to be safer out of her body than in it. Hence the doctor
          must take great care of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg
          328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the piece of iron; for if it were lost, the woman's soul would

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, we have
          seen that in folk-tales a man's soul or strength is sometimes
          represented as bound up with his hair, and that when his hair is
          cut off he dies or grows weak. So the natives of Amboina used to
          think that their strength was in their hair and would desert them
          if it were shorn. A criminal under torture in a Dutch Court of that
          island persisted in denying his guilt till his hair was cut off,
          when he immediately confessed. One man who was tried for murder
          endured without flinching the utmost ingenuity of his torturers
          till he saw the surgeon standing with a pair of shears. On asking
          what this was for, and being told that it was to cut his hair, he
          begged they would not do it, and made a clean breast. In subsequent
          cases, when torture failed to wring a confession from a prisoner,
          the Dutch authorities made a practice of cutting off his
          hair.<a id="noteref_862" name="noteref_862" href=

          follows. The young Indian went into the forest to a lonely place by
          a river or to the top of a mountain, and prayed with tears to the
          gods that they would vouchsafe to him what his forefathers had
          possessed before him. After sacrificing a dog or a bird he laid
          himself down to sleep. Then in a dream or after awakening from
          sleep there appeared to him a jaguar, puma, coyote (prairie-wolf),
          crocodile, serpent, or bird. To this visionary animal the Indian
          offered blood drawn from his tongue, his ears, and other parts of
          his body, and prayed for an abundant yield of salt and cacao. Then
          the animal said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“On such and such a
          day you shall go out hunting, and the first animal that meets you

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nagual</span></span> of the highest chief was
          especially conspicuous, because it had the form of a great bird,
          resplendent in green plumage. The Spanish general Pedro de Alvarado
          killed the bird with his lance, and at the same moment the Indian
          chief fell dead to the ground.<a id="noteref_884" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In many of the
          Australian tribes each sex regards a particular species of animals
          in the same way that a Central American Indian regards his
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nagual</span></span>, but with this
          difference, that whereas the Indian apparently knows the individual
          animal with which his life is bound up, the Australians only know
          that each of their lives is bound up with some one animal of the
          species, but they cannot say with which. The result naturally is
          that every man spares and protects all the animals of the species
          with which the lives of the men are bound up; and every woman
          spares and protects all the animals of the species with which the
          lives of the women are bound up; because no one knows but that the
          death of any animal of the respective species might entail his or
          her own; just as the killing of the green bird was immediately
          followed by the death of the Indian chief, and the killing of the
          parrot by the death of Punchkin in the fairy tale. Thus, for
          example, the Wotjobaluk tribe of South Eastern Australia
          <span class="tei tei-q">“held that <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
          life of Ngŭnŭngŭnŭt (the Bat) is the life of a man and the life of
          Yártatgŭrk (the Nightjar) is the life of a woman,’</span> and that
          when either of these creatures is killed the life of some man or of
          some woman is shortened. In such a case every man or every woman
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name=
          "Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the camp feared
          that he or she might be the victim, and from this cause great
          fights arose in this tribe. I learn that in these fights, men on
          one side and women on the other, it was not at all certain which
          would be victorious, for at times the women gave the men a severe
          drubbing with their yamsticks while often women were injured or
          killed by spears.”</span><a id="noteref_885" name="noteref_885"
          href="#note_885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">885</span></span></a> The
          particular species of animals with which the lives of the sexes
          were believed to be respectively bound up varied somewhat from
          tribe to tribe. Thus whereas among the Wotjobaluk the bat was the
          animal of the men, at Gunbower Creek on the lower Murray the bat
          seems to have been the animal of the women, for the natives would
          not kill it for the reason that <span class="tei tei-q">“if it was
          killed, one of their lubras [women] would be sure to die in
          consequence.”</span><a id="noteref_886" name="noteref_886" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a> But
          the belief itself and the fights to which it gave rise are known to
          have extended over a large part of South Eastern Australia, and
          probably they extended much farther.<a id="noteref_887" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">887</span></span></a> The
          belief is a very serious one, and so consequently are the fights
          which spring from it. Thus where the bat is the men's animal they
          <span class="tei tei-q">“protect it against injury, even to the
          half-killing of their wives for its sake;”</span> and where the
          fern owl or large goatsucker (a night bird) is the women's animal,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it is jealously protected by them. If a
          man kills one, they are as much enraged as if it was one of their
          children, and will strike him with their long poles.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The jealous
          protection thus afforded by Australian men and women to bats and
          owls respectively (for bats <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> and owls seem to be the creatures usually
          allotted to men and women respectively) is not based upon purely
          selfish considerations. For each man believes that not only his own
          life, but the lives of his father, brothers, sons, etc., are bound
          up with the lives of particular bats, and that therefore in
          protecting the bat species he is protecting the lives of all his
          male relations as well as his own. Similarly, each woman believes
          that the lives of her mother, sisters, daughters, etc., equally
          with her own, are bound up with the lives of particular owls, and
          that in guarding the owl species she is guarding the lives of all
          her female relations in addition to her own. Now, when men's lives
          are thus supposed to be contained in certain animals, it is obvious
          that the animals can hardly be distinguished from the men, or the
          men from the animals. If my brother John's life is in a bat, then,
          on the one hand, the bat is my brother as well as John; and, on the
          other hand, John is in a sense a bat, since his life is in a bat.
          Similarly, if my sister Mary's life is in an owl, then the owl is
          my sister and Mary is an owl. This is a natural enough conclusion,
          and the Australians have not failed to draw it. When the bat is the
          man's animal, it is called his brother; and when the owl is the
          woman's animal, it is called her sister. And conversely a man
          addresses a woman as an owl, and she addresses him as a bat.<a id=

          with the other animals allotted to the sexes respectively in other
          tribes. For example, among the Kurnai all Emu Wrens were
          <span class="tei tei-q">“brothers”</span> of the men, and all the
          men were Emu Wrens; all Superb Warblers were <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sisters”</span> of the women, and all the women were
          Superb Warblers.<a id="noteref_890" name="noteref_890" href=
          "#note_890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when a
          savage names himself after an animal, calls it his brother, and
          refuses to kill it, the animal is said to be his totem. Accordingly
          the bat and the owl, the Emu Wren and the Superb Warbler, may
          properly be described as totems of the sexes. But the assignation
          of a totem to a sex is comparatively rare, and has hitherto been
          discovered nowhere but in Australia. Far more commonly the totem is
          appropriated not to a sex, but to a tribe or clan, and is
          hereditary either in the male or female line. The relation of an
          individual to the tribal totem does not differ in kind from his
          relation to the sex totem; he will not kill it, he speaks of it as
          his brother, and he calls himself by its name.<a id="noteref_891"
          name="noteref_891" href="#note_891"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a> Now
          if the relations are similar, the explanation which holds good of
          the one ought equally to hold good of the other. Therefore the
          reason why a tribe revere a particular species of animals or plants
          (for the tribal totem may be a plant) and call themselves after it,
          must be a belief that the life of each individual of the tribe is
          bound up with some one animal or plant of the species, and that his
          or her death would be the consequence of killing that particular
          animal, or destroying that particular plant. This explanation of
          totemism squares very well with Sir George Grey's definition of a
          totem or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kobong</span></span> in Western Australia. He
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“A certain mysterious connection
          exists between a family and its <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kobong</span></span>, so that a member of the
          family will never kill an animal of the species to which his
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kobong</span></span> belongs, should he find
          it asleep; indeed he always kills it reluctantly, and never without
          affording it a chance to escape. This arises from the family belief
          that some one individual of the species is their nearest friend, to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name=

          great crime, and to be carefully avoided. Similarly, a native who
          has a vegetable for his <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          it will be observed that though each man spares all the animals or
          plants of the species, they are not all equally precious to him;
          far from it, out of the whole species there is only one which is
          specially dear to him; but as he does not know which the dear one
          is, he is obliged to spare them all from fear of injuring the one.
          Again, this explanation of the tribal totem harmonises with the
          supposed effect of killing one of the totem species. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“One day one of the blacks killed a crow. Three or four

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">893</span></span></a> Here
          the killing of the crow caused the death of a man of the Crow clan,
          exactly as, in the case of the sex totems, the killing of a bat
          causes the death of a Bat man, or the killing of an owl causes the
          death of an Owl woman. Similarly, the killing of his <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          Banks Islander, and the killing of the animal in which his life is
          stowed away causes the death of the giant or warlock in the fairy
          tale.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that the story of <span class="tei tei-q">“The giant who had no
          heart in his body”</span> furnishes the key to the religious aspect
          of totemism, that is, to the relation which is supposed to subsist
          between a man and his totem. The totem, if I am right, is simply
          the receptacle <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg
          339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          in which a man keeps his life, as Punchkin kept his life in a
          parrot, and Bidasari kept her soul in a golden fish. It is no valid
          objection to this view that when a savage has both a sex totem and
          a tribal totem his life must be bound up with two different
          animals, the death of either of which would entail his own. If a
          man has more vital places than one in his body, why, the savage may
          think, should he not have more vital places than one outside it?
          Why, since he can externalise his life, should he not transfer one
          portion of it to one animal and another to another? The
          divisibility of life, or, to put it otherwise, the plurality of
          souls, is an idea suggested by many familiar facts, and has
          commended itself to philosophers like Plato as well as to savages.
          It is only when the notion of a soul, from being a quasi-scientific
          hypothesis, becomes a theological dogma that its unity and
          indivisibility are insisted upon as essential. The savage,
          unshackled by dogma, is free to explain the facts of life by the
          assumption of as many souls as he thinks necessary. Hence, for
          example, the Caribs supposed that there was one soul in the head,
          another in the heart, and other souls at all the places where an
          artery is felt pulsating.<a id="noteref_894" name="noteref_894"
          href="#note_894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          of the Hidatsa Indians explain the phenomena of gradual death, when
          the extremities appear dead first, by supposing that man has four
          souls, and that they quit the body, not simultaneously, but one
          after the other, dissolution being only complete when all four have
          departed.<a id="noteref_895" name="noteref_895" href=

          Hence, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg
          340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          from the primitive point of view, it is perfectly possible that a
          savage should have one soul in his sex totem, and another in his
          tribal totem. However, as I have observed, sex totems occur nowhere
          but in Australia; so that as a rule the savage who practises
          totemism need not have more than one soul out of his body at a
          time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this
          explanation of the totem as a receptacle in which a man keeps his
          soul or one of his souls is correct, we should expect to find some
          totemistic tribes of whom it is expressly stated that every man
          amongst them is believed to keep at least one soul permanently out
          of his body, and that the destruction of this external soul is
          supposed to entail the death of its owner. Such a tribe are the
          Battas of Sumatra. The Battas are divided into exogamous clans
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">margas</span></span>) with descent in the male
          line; and each clan is forbidden to eat the flesh of a particular
          animal. One clan may not eat the tiger, another the ape, another
          the crocodile, another the dog, another the cat, another the dove,
          another the white buffalo. The reason given by members of a clan
          for abstaining from the flesh of the particular animal is either
          that they are descended from animals of that species, and that
          their souls after death may transmigrate into the animals, or that
          they or their forefathers have been under certain obligations to
          the animals. Sometimes, but not always, the clan bears the name of
          the animal.<a id="noteref_897" name="noteref_897" href=
          "#note_897"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">897</span></span></a> Thus
          the Battas have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg
          341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          totemism in full. But, further, each Batta believes that he has
          seven or, on a more moderate computation, three souls. One of these
          souls is always outside the body, but nevertheless whenever it
          dies, however far away it may be at the time, that same moment the
          man dies also.<a id="noteref_898" name="noteref_898" href=
          "#note_898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">898</span></span></a> The
          writer who mentions this belief says nothing about the Batta
          totems; but on the analogy of the Australian and Central American
          evidence we can scarcely avoid concluding that the external soul,
          whose death entails the death of the man, must be housed in the
          totem animal or plant.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Against this
          view it can hardly be thought to militate that the Batta does not
          in set terms affirm his external soul to be in his totem, but
          alleges other, though hardly contradictory, grounds for respecting
          the sacred animal or plant of his clan. For if a savage seriously
          believes that his life is bound up with an external object, it is
          in the last degree unlikely that he will let any stranger into the
          secret. In all that touches his inmost life and beliefs the savage
          is exceedingly suspicious and reserved; Europeans have resided
          among savages for years without discovering some of their capital
          articles of faith, and in the end the discovery has often been the
          result of accident. Above all, the savage lives in an intense and
          perpetual dread of assassination by sorcery; the most trifling
          relics of his person—the clippings of his hair and nails, his
          spittle, the remnants of his food, his very name—all these may, he
          fancies, be turned by the sorcerer to his destruction, and he is
          therefore anxiously careful to conceal or destroy them. But if in
          matters such as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg
          342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          these, which are but the outposts and outworks of his life, he is
          shy and secretive to a degree, how close must be the concealment,
          how impenetrable the reserve in which he enshrouds the inner keep
          and citadel of his being! When the princess in the fairy tale asks
          the giant where he keeps his soul, he generally gives false or
          evasive answers, and it is only after much coaxing and wheedling
          that the secret is at last wrung from him. In his jealous reticence
          the giant resembles the timid and furtive savage; but whereas the
          exigencies of the story demand that the giant should at last reveal
          his secret, no such obligation is laid on the savage; and no
          inducement that can be offered is likely to tempt him to imperil
          his soul by revealing its hiding-place to a stranger. It is
          therefore no matter for surprise that the central mystery of the
          savage's life should so long have remained a secret, and that we
          should be left to piece it together from scattered hints and
          fragments and from the recollections of it which linger in fairy
          tales.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This view of
          totemism throws light on a class of religious rites of which no
          adequate explanation, so far as I am aware, has yet been offered.
          Amongst many savage tribes, especially such as are known to
          practise totemism, it is customary for lads at puberty to undergo
          certain initiatory rites, of which one of the commonest is a
          pretence of killing the lad and bringing him to life again. Such
          rites become intelligible if we suppose that their substance
          consists in extracting the youth's soul in order to transfer it to
          his totem. For the extraction of his soul would naturally be
          supposed to kill the youth or, at least, to throw him into a
          death-like trance, which the savage hardly distinguishes from
          death. His recovery would then be attributed either <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to the gradual recovery of his system
          from the violent shock which it had received, or, more probably, to
          the infusion into him of fresh life drawn from the totem. Thus the
          essence of these initiatory rites, so far as they consist in a
          simulation of death and resurrection, would be an exchange of life
          or souls between the man and his totem. The primitive belief in the
          possibility of such an exchange of souls comes clearly out in the
          story of the Basque hunter who affirmed that he had been killed by
          a bear, but that the bear had, after killing him, breathed its own
          soul into him, so that the bear's body was now dead, but he himself
          was a bear, being animated by the bear's soul.<a id="noteref_899"
          name="noteref_899" href="#note_899"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a> This
          revival of the dead hunter as a bear is exactly analogous to what,
          if I am right, is supposed to take place in the totemistic ceremony
          of killing a lad at puberty and bringing him to life again. The lad
          dies as a man and comes to life again as an animal; the animal's
          soul is now in him, and his human soul is in the animal. With good
          right, therefore, does he call himself a Bear or a Wolf, etc.,
          according to his totem; and with good right does he treat the bears
          or the wolves, etc., as his brethren, since in these animals are
          lodged the souls of himself and his kindred.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Examples of this
          supposed death and resurrection at initiation are the following.
          Among some of the Australian tribes of New South Wales, when lads
          are initiated, it is thought that a being called Thuremlin takes
          each lad to a distance, kills him, and sometimes cuts him up, after
          which he restores him to life and knocks out a tooth.<a id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> humming sound of the Bullroarer, which is
          swung at the initiatory rites, is said to be the noise made by the
          wizards in swallowing the boys and bringing them up again as young
          men. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Ualaroi of the Upper Darling
          River say that the boy meets a ghost which kills him and brings him

          resurrection appears to be represented at the initiatory rites by
          the following ceremony. An old man, disguised with stringy bark
          fibre, lies down in a grave, and is lightly covered up with sticks
          and earth, and as far as possible the natural appearance of the
          ground is restored, the excavated earth being carried away. The
          buried man holds a small bush in his hand; it appears to be growing
          in the soil, and other bushes are stuck in the soil to heighten the
          effect. The novices are then brought to the edge of the grave, and
          a song is sung, in which the only words used are the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“class-name”</span> of the buried man and the word for
          stringy bark fibre. Gradually, as the song continues, the bush held
          by the buried man begins to quiver and then to move more and more,
          and finally the man himself starts up from the grave.<a id=

          Similarly, Fijian lads at initiation were shown a row of apparently
          dead men, covered with blood, their bodies seemingly cut open, and
          their entrails protruding. But at a yell from the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> priest the pretended dead men sprang to
          their feet and ran to the river to cleanse themselves from the
          blood and entrails of pigs with which they had been
          besmeared.<a id="noteref_903" name="noteref_903" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the valley of
          the Congo initiatory rites of this sort are common. In some places
          they are called Ndembo. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the practice of
          Ndembo the initiating doctors get some one to fall down in a
          pretended fit, and in that state he is carried away to an enclosed
          place outside the town. This is called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘dying Ndembo.’</span> Others follow suit, generally
          boys and girls, but often young men and women.... They are supposed
          to have died. But the parents and friends supply food, and after a
          period varying, according to custom, from three months to three
          years, it is arranged that the doctor shall bring them to life
          again.... When the doctor's fee has been paid, and money (goods)
          saved for a feast, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          life. At first they pretend to know no one and nothing; they do not
          even know how to masticate food, and friends have to perform that
          office for them. They want everything nice that any one uninitiated
          may have, and beat them if it is not granted, or even strangle and
          kill people. They do not get into trouble for this, because it is
          thought that they do not know better. Sometimes they carry on the
          pretence of talking gibberish, and behaving as if they had returned
          from the spirit-world. After this they are known by another name,
          peculiar to those who have <span class="tei tei-q">‘died

          generally awake after three days. But if the fetish loves a man he
          carries him away into the bush and buries him in the fetish house,
          often for many years. When he comes to life again, he begins to eat
          and drink as before, but his understanding is gone and the fetish
          man must teach him and direct him in every motion, like the
          smallest child. At first this can only be done with a stick, but
          gradually his senses return, so that it is possible to talk with
          him, and when his education is complete, the priest brings him back
          to his parents. They would seldom recognise their son but for the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rites of this
          sort were formerly observed in Quoja, on the west coast of Africa,
          to the north of the Congo. They are thus described by an old
          writer:—<span class="tei tei-q">“They have another ceremony which
          they call Belli-Paaro, but it is not for everybody. For it is an
          incorporation in the assembly of the spirits, and confers the right
          of entering their groves, that is to say, of going and eating the
          offerings which the simple folk bring thither. The initiation or
          admission to the Belli-Paaro is celebrated every twenty or
          twenty-five years. The initiated recount marvels of the ceremony,
          saying that they are roasted, that they entirely change their
          habits and life, and that they receive a spirit quite different
          from that of other people and quite new lights. The badge of
          membership consists in some lines traced on the neck between the
          shoulders; the lines seem to be pricked with a needle. Those who
          have this mark pass for persons of spirit, and when they have
          attained a certain age they are allowed a voice in all public
          assemblies; whereas the uninitiated are regarded as profane,
          impure, and ignorant persons, who dare not express an opinion on
          any subject of importance. When the time for the ceremony has come,
          it is celebrated as follows: By order of the king a place is
          appointed in the forest, whither they bring the youths who have not
          been marked, not without much crying and weeping; for it is
          impressed upon the youths that in order to undergo this change it
          is necessary to suffer death. So they dispose of their property, as
          if it were all over with them. There are always some of the
          initiated beside the novices to instruct them. They teach them to
          dance a certain dance called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">killing</span></span>, and to sing verses in
          praise of Belli. Above all, they are very careful not to let them
          die of hunger, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg
          348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          because if they did so, it is much to be feared that the spiritual
          resurrection would profit them nothing. This manner of life lasts
          five or six years, and is comfortable enough, for there is a
          village in the forest, and they amuse themselves with hunting and
          fishing. Other lads are brought thither from time to time, so that
          the last comers have not long to stay. No woman or uninitiated
          person is suffered to pass within four or five leagues of the
          sacred wood. When their instruction is completed, they are taken
          from the wood and shut up in small huts made for the purpose. Here
          they begin once more to hold communion with mankind and to talk
          with the women who bring them their food. It is amusing to see
          their affected simplicity. They pretend to know no one, and to be
          ignorant of all the customs of the country, such as the customs of
          washing themselves, rubbing themselves with oil, etc. When they
          enter these huts, their bodies are all covered with the feathers of
          birds, and they wear caps of bark which hang down before their
          faces. But after a time they are dressed in clothes and taken to a
          great open place, where all the people of the neighbourhood are
          assembled. Here the novices give the first proof of their capacity
          by dancing a dance which is called the dance of Belli. After the
          dance is over, the novices are taken to the houses of their parents
          by their instructors.”</span><a id="noteref_907" name="noteref_907"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Indians of Virginia, an initiatory ceremony, called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Huskanaw</span></span>, took place every
          sixteen or twenty years, or oftener, as the young men happened to
          grow up. The youths were kept in solitary confinement in the woods
          for several months, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg
          349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          receiving no food but an infusion of some intoxicating roots, so
          that they went raving mad, and continued in this state eighteen or
          twenty days. <span class="tei tei-q">“Upon this occasion it is
          pretended that these poor creatures drink so much of the water of
          Lethe that they perfectly lose the remembrance of all former
          things, even of their parents, their treasure, and their language.
          When the doctors find that they have drank sufficiently of the
          Wysoccan (so they call this mad potion), they gradually restore
          them to their senses again by lessening the intoxication of their
          diet; but before they are perfectly well they bring them back into
          their towns, while they are still wild and crazy through the
          violence of the medicine. After this they are very fearful of
          discovering anything of their former remembrance; for if such a
          thing should happen to any of them, they must immediately be
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Huskanaw'd</span></span> again; and the second
          time the usage is so severe that seldom any one escapes with life.
          Thus they must pretend to have forgot the very use of their
          tongues, so as not to be able to speak, nor understand anything
          that is spoken, till they learn it again. Now, whether this be real
          or counterfeit, I don't know; but certain it is that they will not
          for some time take notice of any body nor any thing with which they
          were before acquainted, being still under the guard of their
          keepers, who constantly wait upon them everywhere till they have
          learnt all things perfectly over again. Thus they unlive their
          former lives, and commence men by forgetting that they ever have
          been boys.”</span><a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among some of
          the Indian tribes of North America there are certain religious
          associations which are only open to candidates who have gone
          through a pretence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg
          350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of being killed and brought to life again. Captain Carver witnessed
          the admission of a candidate to an association called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the friendly society of the Spirit”</span> among the
          Naudowessies. The candidate knelt before the chief, who told him
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“he himself was now agitated by the
          same spirit which he should in a few moments communicate to him;
          that it would strike him dead, but that he would instantly be
          restored again to life.... As he spoke this, he appeared to be
          greatly agitated, till at last his emotions became so violent that
          his countenance was distorted and his whole frame convulsed. At
          this juncture he threw something that appeared both in shape and
          colour like a small bean at the young man, which seemed to enter
          his mouth, and he instantly fell as motionless as if he had been
          shot.”</span> For a time the man lay like dead, but under a shower
          of blows he showed signs of consciousness, and finally, discharging
          from his mouth the bean, or whatever it was the chief had thrown at
          him, he came to life.<a id="noteref_909" name="noteref_909" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">909</span></span></a> In
          other tribes the instrument by which the candidate is apparently
          slain is the medicine-bag. The bag is made of the skin of an animal
          (such as the otter, wild cat, serpent, bear, raccoon, wolf, owl,
          weasel), of which it roughly preserves the shape. Each member of
          the society has one of these bags, in which he keeps the odds and
          ends that make up his <span class="tei tei-q">“medicine”</span> or
          charms. <span class="tei tei-q">“They believe that from the
          miscellaneous contents in the belly of the skin bag or animal there
          issues a spirit or breath, which has the power, not only to knock
          down and kill a man, but also to set him up and restore him to
          life.”</span> The mode of killing a man with one of these
          medicine-bags is to thrust it at him; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> he falls like dead, but a second thrust of
          the bag restores him to life.<a id="noteref_910" name="noteref_910"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A ceremony
          witnessed by Jewitt during his captivity among the Indians of
          Nootka Sound doubtless belongs to this class of customs. The Indian
          king or chief <span class="tei tei-q">“discharged a pistol close to
          his son's ear, who immediately fell down as if killed, upon which
          all the women of the house set up a most lamentable cry, tearing
          handfuls of hair from their heads, and exclaiming that the prince
          was dead; at the same time a great number of the inhabitants rushed
          into the house armed with their daggers, muskets, etc., inquiring
          the cause of their outcry. These were immediately followed by two
          others dressed in wolf skins, with masks over their faces
          representing the head of that animal. The latter came in on their
          hands and feet in the manner of a beast, and taking up the prince,
          carried him off upon their backs, retiring in the same manner as
          they entered.”</span><a id="noteref_911" name="noteref_911" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">911</span></span></a> In
          another place Jewitt mentions that the young prince—a lad of about
          eleven years of age—wore a mask in imitation of a wolf's
          head.<a id="noteref_912" name="noteref_912" href=

          as the Indians of this part of America are divided into totem
          clans, of which the Wolf clan is one of the principal, and as the
          members of each clan are in the habit of wearing some portion of
          the totem animal about their person,<a id="noteref_913" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">913</span></span></a> it is
          probable that the prince belonged to the Wolf clan, and that the
          ceremony described by Jewitt represented the killing <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the lad in order that he might be
          born anew as a wolf, much in the same way that the Basque hunter
          supposed himself to have been killed and to have come to life again
          as a bear. The Toukaway Indians of Texas, one of whose totems is
          the wolf, have a ceremony in which men, dressed in wolf skins, run
          about on all fours, howling and mimicking wolves. At last they
          scratch up a living tribesman, who has been buried on purpose, and
          putting a bow and arrows in his hands, bid him do as the wolves
          do—rob, kill, and murder.<a id="noteref_914" name="noteref_914"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a> The
          ceremony probably forms part of an initiatory rite like the
          resurrection from the grave of the old man in the Australian
          rites.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people of
          Rook, an island east of New Guinea, hold festivals at which one or
          two disguised men, their heads covered with wooden masks, go
          dancing through the village, followed by all the other men. They
          demand that the circumcised boys who have not yet been swallowed by
          Marsaba (the devil) shall be given up to them. The boys, trembling
          and shrieking, are delivered to them, and must creep between the
          legs of the disguised men. Then the procession moves through the
          village again, and announces that Marsaba has eaten up the boys,
          and will not disgorge them till he receives a present of pigs,
          taro, etc. So all the villagers, according to their means,
          contribute provisions, which are then consumed in the name of
          Marsaba.<a id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915" href=

          boys are admitted to it very young, but are not fully initiated
          till their fourteenth year, when they receive from the Tubuvan a
          terrible blow with a cane, which is supposed to kill them. The
          Tubuvan and the Duk-duk are two disguised men who represent
          cassowaries. They dance with a short hopping step in imitation of
          the cassowary. Each of them wears a huge hat like an extinguisher,
          woven of grass or palm-fibres; it is six feet high, and descends to
          the wearer's shoulders, completely concealing his head and face.
          From the neck to the knees the man's body is hidden by a crinoline
          made of the leaves of a certain tree fastened on hoops, one above
          the other. The Tubuvan is regarded as a female, the Duk-duk as a
          male. No woman may see these disguised men. The institution of the
          Duk-duk is common to the neighbouring islands of New Ireland and
          the Duke of York.<a id="noteref_916" name="noteref_916" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amongst the
          Galela and Tobelorese of Halmahera, an island to the west of New
          Guinea, boys go through a form of initiation, part of which seems
          to consist in a pretence of begetting them anew. When a number of
          boys have reached the proper age, their parents agree to celebrate
          the ceremony at their common expense, and they invite others to be
          present at it. A shed is erected, and two long tables are placed in
          it, with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg
          354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          benches to match, one for the men and one for the women. When all
          the preparations have been made for a feast, a great many skins of
          the rayfish, and some pieces of a wood which imparts a red colour
          to water, are taken to the shed. A priest or elder causes a vessel
          to be placed in the sight of all the people, and then begins, with
          significant gestures, to rub a piece of the wood with the ray-skin.
          The powder so produced is put in the vessel, and at the same time
          the name of one of the boys is called out. The same proceeding is
          repeated for each boy. Then the vessels are filled with water,
          after which the feast begins. At the third cock-crow the priest
          smears the faces and bodies of the boys with the red water, which
          represents the blood shed at the perforation of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hymen</span></em>.
          Towards daybreak the boys are taken to the wood, and must hide
          behind the largest trees. The men, armed with sword and shield,
          accompany them, dancing and singing. The priest knocks thrice on
          each of the trees behind which a boy is hiding. All day the boys
          stay in the wood, exposing themselves to the heat of the sun as
          much as possible. In the evening they bathe and return to the shed,
          where the women supply them with food.<a id="noteref_917" name=

          have commonly regarded this association as primarily a political
          league instituted to resist foreign domination. In reality its
          objects are purely religious and social, though it is possible that
          the priests may have occasionally used their powerful influence for
          political ends. The society is in fact merely one of those
          widely-diffused primitive institutions, of which a chief object is
          the initiation of young men. In recent years the true nature of the
          association has been duly recognised by the distinguished Dutch
          ethnologist, J. G. F. Riedel. The Kakian house is an oblong wooden
          shed, situated under the darkest trees in the depth of the forest,
          and is built to admit so little light that it is impossible to see
          what goes on in it. Every village has such a house. Thither the
          boys who are to be initiated are conducted blindfolded, followed by
          their parents and relations. Each boy is led by the hand by two
          men, who act as his sponsors or guardians, looking after him during
          the period of initiation. When all are assembled before the shed,
          the high priest calls aloud upon the devils. Immediately a hideous
          uproar is heard to proceed from the shed. It is made by men with
          bamboo trumpets, who have been secretly introduced into the
          building by a back door, but the women and children think it is
          made by the devils, and are much terrified. Then the priests enter
          the shed, followed by the boys, one at a time. As soon as each boy
          has disappeared within the precincts, a dull chopping sound is
          heard, a fearful cry rings out, and a sword or spear, dripping with
          blood, is thrust <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg
          356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          through the roof of the shed. This is a token that the boy's head
          has been cut off, and that the devil has carried him away to the
          other world, there to regenerate and transform him. So at sight of
          the bloody sword the mothers weep and wail, crying that the devil
          has murdered their children. In some places, it would seem, the
          boys are pushed through an opening made in the shape of a
          crocodile's jaws or a cassowary's beak, and it is then said that
          the devil has swallowed them. The boys remain in the shed for five
          or nine days. Sitting in the dark, they hear the blast of the
          bamboo trumpets, and from time to time the sound of musket shots
          and the clash of swords. Every day they bathe, and their faces and
          bodies are smeared with a yellow dye, to give them the appearance
          of having been swallowed by the devil. During his stay in the
          Kakian house each boy has one or two crosses tattooed with thorns
          on his breast or arm. When they are not sleeping, the lads must sit
          in a crouching posture without moving a muscle. As they sit in a
          row cross-legged, with their hands stretched out, the chief takes
          his trumpet, and placing the mouth of it on the hands of each lad,
          speaks through it in strange tones, imitating the voice of the
          spirits. He warns the lads, under pain of death, to observe the
          rules of the Kakian society, and never to reveal what has passed in
          the Kakian house. The novices are also told by the priests to
          behave well to their blood relations, and are taught the traditions
          and secrets of the tribe.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime the
          mothers and sisters of the lads have gone home to weep and mourn.
          But in a day or two the men who acted as guardians or sponsors to
          the novices return to the village with the glad tidings that the
          devil, at the intercession of the priests, has restored
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name=
          "Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the lads to life.
          The men who bring this news come in a fainting state and daubed
          with mud, like messengers freshly arrived from the nether world.
          Before leaving the Kakian house, each lad receives from the priest
          a stick adorned at both ends with cock's or cassowary's feathers.
          The sticks are supposed to have been given to the lads by the devil
          at the time when he restored them to life, and they serve as a
          token that the lads have been in the spirit-land. When they return
          to their homes they totter in their walk, and enter the house
          backward, as if they had forgotten how to walk properly; or they
          enter the house by the back door. If a plate of food is given to
          them, they hold it upside down. They remain dumb, indicating their
          wants by signs only. All this is to show that they are still under
          the influence of the devil or the spirits. Their sponsors have to
          teach them all the common acts of life, as if they were new-born
          children. Further, upon leaving the Kakian house the boys are
          strictly forbidden to eat of certain fruits until the next
          celebration of the rites has taken place. And for twenty or thirty
          days their hair may not be combed by their mothers or sisters. At
          the end of that time the high priest takes them to a lonely place
          in the forest, and cuts off a lock of hair from the crown of each
          of their heads. After these initiatory rites the lads are deemed
          men, and may marry; it would be a scandal if they married
          before.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The simulation
          of death and resurrection or of a new birth at initiation appears
          to have lingered on, or at least to have left traces of itself,
          among peoples who have advanced far beyond the stage of savagery.
          Thus, after his investiture with the sacred thread—the symbol of
          his order—a Brahman is called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“twice-born.”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          to the injunction of the revealed texts the first birth of an Aryan
          is from his natural mother, the second happens on the tying of the
          girdle of Muñga grass, and the third on the initiation to the
          performance of a Srauta sacrifice.”</span><a id="noteref_919" name=

          pretence of killing the candidate appears to have formed part of
          the initiation to the Mithraic mysteries.<a id="noteref_920" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, if I am
          right, wherever totemism is found, and wherever a pretence is made
          of killing and bringing to life again at initiation, there must
          exist or have existed not only a belief in the possibility of
          permanently depositing the soul in some external object—animal,
          plant, or what not—but an actual intention of so depositing it. If
          the question is put, why do men desire to deposit their life
          outside their bodies? the answer can only be that, like the giant
          in the fairy tale, they think it safer to do so than to carry it
          about with them, just as people deposit their money with a banker
          rather than carry it on their persons. We have seen that at
          critical periods the life or soul is sometimes temporarily
          deposited in a safe place till the danger is past. But institutions
          like totemism are not resorted to merely on special occasions of
          danger; they are systems into which every one, or at least every
          male, is obliged to be initiated at a certain period of life. Now
          the period of life at which initiation takes place is regularly
          puberty; and this fact suggests that the special danger which
          totemism and systems like it are intended to obviate is supposed
          not to arise till sexual maturity has been attained, in fact, that
          the danger <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg
          359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          apprehended is believed to attend the relation of the sexes to each
          other. It would be easy to prove by a long array of facts that the
          sexual relation is associated in the primitive mind with many
          supernatural perils; but the exact nature of the danger apprehended
          is still obscure. We may hope that a more exact acquaintance with
          savage modes of thought will in time disclose this central mystery
          of primitive society, and will thereby furnish the clue, not only
          to the social aspect of totemism (the prohibition of sexual union
          between persons of the same totem), but to the origin of the
          marriage system.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the view
          that Balder's life was in the mistletoe is entirely in harmony with
          primitive modes of thought. It may indeed sound like a
          contradiction that, if his life was in the mistletoe, he should
          nevertheless have been killed by a blow from it. But when a
          person's life is conceived as embodied in a particular object, with
          the existence of which his own existence is inseparably bound up,
          and the destruction of which involves his own, the object in
          question may be regarded and spoken of indifferently as the
          person's life or as his death, as happens in the fairy tales. Hence
          if a man's death is in an object, it is perfectly natural that he
          should be killed by a blow from it. In the fairy tales Koshchei the
          Deathless is killed by a blow from the egg or the stone in which

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea that
          the life of the oak was in the mistletoe was probably suggested, as
          I have said, by the observation that in winter the mistletoe
          growing on the oak remains green, while the oak itself is leafless.
          But the position of the plant—growing, not from the ground, but
          from the trunk or branches of the tree—might confirm this idea.
          Primitive man might think that, like himself, the oak-spirit had
          sought to deposit his life in some safe place, and for this purpose
          had pitched on the mistletoe, which, being in a sense neither on
          earth nor in heaven, was as secure a place as could be found. At
          the beginning of this chapter we saw that primitive man seeks to
          preserve the life of his human divinities by keeping them in a sort
          of intermediate position between earth and heaven, as the place
          where they are least likely to be assailed by the dangers that
          encompass the life of man on earth. We can therefore <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> understand why in modern folk-medicine
          the mistletoe is not allowed to touch the ground; if it touches the
          ground, its healing virtue is supposed to be gone.<a id=
          "noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href="#note_925"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a> This
          may be a survival of the old superstition that the plant in which
          the life of the sacred tree was concentrated should not be exposed
          to the risk incurred by contact with the ground. In an Indian
          legend, which offers a parallel to the Balder myth, Indra promised
          the demon Namuci not to kill him by day or by night, nor with what
          was wet or what was dry. But he killed him in the morning twilight
          by sprinkling over him the foam of the sea.<a id="noteref_926"
          name="noteref_926" href="#note_926"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a> The
          foam of the sea is just such an object as a savage might choose to
          put his life in, because it occupies that sort of intermediate or
          nondescript position between earth and sky or sea and sky in which
          primitive man sees safety. It is therefore not surprising that the
          foam of the river should be the totem of a clan in India.<a id=
          "noteref_927" name="noteref_927" href="#note_927"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a>
          Again, the view that the mistletoe owes its mystic character partly
          to the fact of its not growing on the ground is confirmed by a
          parallel superstition about the mountain-ash or rowan-tree. In
          Jutland a rowan that is found growing out of the top of another
          tree is esteemed <span class="tei tei-q">“exceedingly effective
          against witchcraft: since it does not grow on the ground witches
          have no power over it; if it is to have its full effect it must be
          cut on Ascension Day.”</span><a id="noteref_928" name="noteref_928"
          href="#note_928"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a> Hence
          it is placed over doors to prevent the ingress of witches.<a id=
          "noteref_929" name="noteref_929" href="#note_929"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">929</span></span></a>
          Similarly the mistletoe in Germany is still <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> universally considered a protection
          against witchcraft, and in Sweden, as we saw, the mistletoe which
          is gathered on Midsummer Eve is attached to the ceiling of the
          house, the horse stall, or the cow's crib, in the belief that this
          renders the Troll powerless to injure man or beast.<a id=
          "noteref_930" name="noteref_930" href="#note_930"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view that
          the mistletoe was not merely the instrument of Balder's death, but
          that it contained his life, is countenanced by the analogy of a
          Scottish superstition. Tradition ran that the fate of the family of
          Hay was bound up with the mistletoe of a certain oak.</p>

          idea that the fate of a family, as distinct from the lives of its
          members, is bound up with a particular plant or tree, is no doubt
          comparatively modern. The older view probably was that the lives of
          all the Hays were in this particular mistletoe, just as in the
          Indian story the lives of all the ogres are in a lemon; to break a
          twig of the mistletoe would then have been to kill one <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Hays. Similarly in the island of
          Rum, whose bold mountains the voyager from Oban to Skye observes to
          seaward, it was thought that if one of the family of Lachlin shot a
          deer on the mountain of Finchra, he would die suddenly or contract
          a distemper which would soon prove fatal.<a id="noteref_932" name=

          Probably the life of the Lachlins was bound up with the deer on
          Finchra, as the life of the Hays was bound up with the mistletoe on
          Errol's oak.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not a new

          Virgil does not identify but only compares it with the mistletoe.
          But this may be only a poetical device to cast a mystic glamour
          over the humble plant. Or, more probably, his description was based
          on a popular superstition that at certain times the mistletoe
          blazed out into a supernatural golden glory. The poet tells how two
          doves, guiding Aeneas to the gloomy vale in whose depth grew the
          Golden Bough, alighted upon a tree, <span class="tei tei-q">“whence
          shone a flickering gleam of gold. As in the woods in winter cold
          the mistletoe—a plant not native to its tree—is green with fresh
          leaves and twines its yellow berries about the boles; such seemed
          upon the shady oak the leafy gold, so rustled in the gentle breeze
          the golden leaf.”</span><a id="noteref_934" name="noteref_934"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">934</span></span></a> Here
          Virgil definitely describes the Golden Bough as growing on an oak,
          and compares it with the mistletoe. The inference is almost
          inevitable that the Golden Bough was nothing but the mistletoe seen
          through the haze of poetry or of popular superstition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now grounds have
          been shown for believing that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the priest of the Arician grove—the King of
          the Wood—personified the tree on which grew the Golden Bough.<a id=
          "noteref_935" name="noteref_935" href="#note_935"><span class=

          Hence, if that tree was the oak, the King of the Wood must have
          been a personification of the oak-spirit. It is, therefore, easy to
          understand why, before he could be slain, it was necessary to break
          the Golden Bough. As an oak-spirit, his life or death was in the
          mistletoe on the oak, and so long as the mistletoe remained intact,
          he, like Balder, could not die. To slay him, therefore, it was
          necessary to break the mistletoe, and probably, as in the case of
          Balder, to throw it at him. And to complete the parallel, it is
          only necessary to suppose that the King of the Wood was formerly
          burned, dead or alive, at the midsummer fire festival which, as we
          have seen, was annually celebrated in the Arician grove.<a id=
          "noteref_936" name="noteref_936" href="#note_936"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">936</span></span></a> The
          perpetual fire which burned in the grove, like the perpetual fire
          under the oak at Romove, was probably fed with the sacred oak-wood;
          and thus it would be in a great fire of oak that the King of the
          Wood formerly met his end. At a later time, as I have suggested,
          his annual tenure of office was lengthened or shortened, as the
          case might be, by the rule which allowed him to live so long as he
          could prove his divine right by the strong hand. But he only
          escaped the fire to fall by the sword.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it seems
          that at a remote age in the heart of Italy, beside the sweet lake
          of Nemi, the same fiery tragedy was annually enacted which Italian
          merchants and soldiers were afterwards to witness among their rude
          kindred, the Celts of Gaul, and which, if the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Roman eagles had ever swooped on
          Norway, might have been found repeated with little difference among
          the barbarous Aryans of the North. The rite was probably an
          essential feature in the primitive Aryan worship of the oak.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It only remains
          to ask, Why was the mistletoe called the Golden Bough? The name was
          not simply a poet's fancy, nor even peculiarly Italian; for in
          Welsh also the mistletoe is known as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          tree of pure gold.”</span><a id="noteref_938" name="noteref_938"
          href="#note_938"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">938</span></span></a> The
          whitish-yellow of the mistletoe berries is hardly enough to account
          for the name. For Virgil says that the Bough was altogether golden,
          stem as well as leaves,<a id="noteref_939" name="noteref_939" href=
          "#note_939"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">939</span></span></a> and
          the same is implied in the Welsh name, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          tree of pure gold.”</span> A clue to the real meaning of the name
          is furnished by the mythical fern-seed or fern-bloom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We saw that
          fern-seed is popularly supposed to bloom like gold or fire on
          Midsummer Eve. Thus in Bohemia it is said that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“on St. John's Day fern-seed blooms with golden
          blossoms that gleam like fire.”</span><a id="noteref_940" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">940</span></span></a> Now
          it is a property of this mythical fern-seed that whoever has it, or
          will ascend a mountain holding it in his hand on Midsummer Eve,
          will discover a vein of gold or will see the treasures of the earth
          shining with a bluish flame.<a id="noteref_941" name="noteref_941"
          href="#note_941"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">941</span></span></a> And
          if you place fern-seed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg
          366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          among money, the money will never decrease, however much of it you
          spend.<a id="noteref_942" name="noteref_942" href=
          "#note_942"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a>
          Sometimes the fern-seed is supposed to bloom at Christmas, and
          whoever catches it will become very rich.<a id="noteref_943" name=
          "noteref_943" href="#note_943"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">943</span></span></a> Thus,
          on the principle of like by like, fern-seed is supposed to discover
          gold because it is itself golden; and for a similar reason it
          enriches its possessor with an unfailing supply of gold. But while
          the fern-seed is described as golden, it is equally described as
          glowing and fiery.<a id="noteref_944" name="noteref_944" href=
          "#note_944"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">944</span></span></a>
          Hence, when we consider that two great days for gathering the
          fabulous seed are Midsummer Eve and Christmas—that is, the two
          solstices (for Christmas is nothing but an old heathen celebration
          of the winter solstice)—we are led to regard the fiery aspect of
          the fern-seed as primary, and its golden aspect as secondary and
          derivative. Fern-seed, in fact, would seem to be an emanation of
          the sun's fire at the two turning-points of its course, the summer
          and winter solstices. This view is confirmed by a German story in
          which a hunter is said to have procured fern-seed by shooting at
          the sun on Midsummer Day at noon; three drops of blood fell down,
          which he caught in a white cloth, and these blood-drops were the
          fern-seed.<a id="noteref_945" name="noteref_945" href=
          "#note_945"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">945</span></span></a> Here
          the blood is clearly the blood of the sun, from which the fern-seed
          is thus directly derived. Thus it may be taken as certain that
          fern-seed is golden, because it is believed to be an emanation of
          the sun's golden fire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, like
          fern-seed, the mistletoe is gathered <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> either at Midsummer or Christmas<a id=
          "noteref_946" name="noteref_946" href="#note_946"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">946</span></span></a>—that
          is, at the summer and winter solstices—and, like fern-seed, it is
          supposed to possess the power of revealing treasures in the earth.
          On Midsummer Eve people in Sweden make divining-rods of mistletoe
          or of four different kinds of wood, one of which must be mistletoe.
          The treasure-seeker places the rod on the ground after sundown, and
          when it rests directly over treasure, the rod begins to move as if
          it were alive.<a id="noteref_947" name="noteref_947" href=
          "#note_947"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">947</span></span></a> Now,
          if the mistletoe discovers gold, it must be in its character of the
          Golden Bough; and if it is gathered at the solstices, must not the
          Golden Bough, like the golden fern-seed, be an emanation of the
          sun's fire? The question cannot be answered with a simple
          affirmative. We have seen that the primitive Aryans probably
          kindled the midsummer bonfires as sun-charms, that is, with the
          intention of supplying the sun with fresh fire. But as this fire
          was always elicited by the friction of oak wood,<a id="noteref_948"
          name="noteref_948" href="#note_948"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">948</span></span></a> it
          must have appeared to the primitive Aryan that the sun was
          periodically recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred
          oak. In other words, the oak must have seemed to him the original
          storehouse or reservoir of the fire which was from time to time
          drawn out to feed the sun. But the life of the oak was conceived to
          be in the mistletoe; therefore the mistletoe must have contained
          the seed or germ of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg
          368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          fire which was elicited by friction from the wood of the oak. Thus,
          instead of saying that the mistletoe was an emanation of the sun's
          fire, it would be more correct to say that the sun's fire was
          regarded as an emanation of the mistletoe. No wonder, then, that
          the mistletoe shone with a golden splendour, and was called the
          Golden Bough. Probably, however, like fern-seed, it was thought to
          assume its golden aspect only at those stated times, especially
          midsummer, when fire was drawn from the oak to light up the
          sun.<a id="noteref_949" name="noteref_949" href=
          "#note_949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">949</span></span></a> At
          Pulverbatch, in Shropshire, it was believed within living memory
          that the oak-tree blooms on Midsummer Eve and the blossom withers
          before daylight.<a id="noteref_950" name="noteref_950" href=
          "#note_950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a> This
          fleeting bloom of the oak, if I am right, could originally have
          been nothing but the mistletoe in its character of the Golden
          Bough. As Shropshire borders on Wales, the superstition may be
          Welsh in its immediate origin, though probably the belief is a
          fragment of the primitive Aryan creed. In some parts of Italy, as
          we saw,<a id="noteref_951" name="noteref_951" href=
          "#note_951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a>
          peasants still go out on Midsummer morning to search the oak-trees
          for the <span class="tei tei-q">“oil of St. John,”</span> which,
          like the mistletoe, heals all wounds, and is doubtless the
          mistletoe itself in its glorified aspect. Thus it is easy to
          understand how a title like the Golden Bough or the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“tree of pure gold,”</span> so little descriptive of
          the real appearance of the plant, should have held its ground as a
          name for the mistletoe in Italy and Wales, and probably in other
          parts of the Aryan world.<a id="noteref_952" name="noteref_952"
          href="#note_952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, too, we can
          fully understand why Virbius came to be confounded with the sun. If
          Virbius was, as I have tried to show, a tree-spirit, he must have
          been the spirit of the oak on which grew the Golden Bough; for
          tradition represented him as the first of the Kings of the Wood. As
          an oak-spirit he must have been supposed periodically to rekindle
          the sun's fire, and might therefore easily be confounded with the
          sun itself. Similarly we can explain why Balder, an oak-spirit, was
          described as <span class="tei tei-q">“so fair of face and so
          shining that a light went forth from him,”</span><a id=
          "noteref_953" name="noteref_953" href="#note_953"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> and
          why he should have been so often taken to be the sun. And in
          general we may say that in primitive society, when the only known
          way of making fire is by the friction of wood, the savage must
          necessarily conceive fire as a property stored away, like sap or
          juice, in trees, from which he has laboriously to extract it. Thus
          all trees, or at least the particular sorts of trees whose wood he
          employs in fire-making, must be regarded by him as reservoirs of
          hidden fire, and it is natural that he should describe them by
          epithets like golden, shining, or bright. May not this have been
          the origin of the name, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Bright or
          Shining One”</span> (Zeus, Jove) by which the ancient Greeks and
          Italians designated their supreme god?<a id="noteref_954" name=
          "noteref_954" href="#note_954"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a> It is
          at least highly significant that, amongst <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> both Greeks and Italians, the oak should have
          been the tree of the supreme god, that at his most ancient shrines,
          both in Greece and Italy, this supreme god should have been
          actually represented by an oak, and that so soon as the barbarous
          Aryans of Northern Europe appear in the light of history, they
          should be found, amid all diversities of language, of character,
          and of country, nevertheless at one in worshipping the oak as the
          chief object of their religious reverence, and extracting their
          sacred fire from its wood. If we are to judge of the primitive
          religion of the European Aryans by comparing the religions of the
          different branches of the stock, the highest place in their
          pantheon must certainly be assigned to the oak. The result, then,
          of our inquiry is to make it probable that, down to the time of the
          Roman Empire and the beginning of our era, the primitive worship of
          the Aryans was maintained nearly in its original form in the sacred
          grove at Nemi, as in the oak woods of Gaul, of Prussia, and of
          Scandinavia; and that the King of the Wood lived and died as an
          incarnation of the supreme Aryan god, whose life was in the
          mistletoe or Golden Bough.</p>

        that primitive peoples often partake of the new corn sacramentally,
        because they suppose it to be instinct with a divine spirit or life.
        At a later age, when the fruits of the earth are conceived as
        produced rather than as animated by a divinity, the new fruits are no
        longer partaken of sacramentally as the body and blood of a god; but
        a portion of them is presented as a thank-offering to the divine
        beings who are believed to have produced them. Sometimes the
        first-fruits are presented to the king, probably in his character of
        a god. Till the first-fruits have been offered to the deity or the
        king, people are not at liberty to eat of the new crops. But, as it
        is not always possible to draw a sharp line between the sacrament and
        the sacrifice of first-fruits, it may be well to round off this part
        of the subject by appending some miscellaneous examples of the
        latter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Basutos,
        when the corn has been threshed and winnowed, it is left in a heap on
        the threshing-floor. Before it can be touched a religious ceremony
        must be performed. The persons to whom the corn belongs bring a new
        vessel to the spot, in which they boil some of the grain. When it is
        boiled they throw a few handfuls of it on the heap of corn, saying,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you, gods; give us bread to-morrow

        a little hollow filled with grain, as a thank-offering to the

        lively sense of the sanctity of the corn in itself; for, so long as
        it is exposed to view, all defiled persons are carefully kept from
        it. If it is necessary to employ a defiled person in carrying home
        the harvest, he remains at some distance while the sacks are being
        filled, and only approaches to place them upon the draught oxen. As
        soon as the load is deposited at the dwelling he retires, and under
        no pretext may he help to pour the corn into the baskets in which it
        is kept.<a id="noteref_957" name="noteref_957" href=

        with great ceremony, before the bulk of the crop is dug for the
        people's use, and no man may taste of the new yams until the
        presentation has been made. The yams thus offered are piled in the
        Great Nanga, and are allowed to rot there. If any one were impiously

        were deified after their death, addressed by name, and prayed to on
        various occasions. They were supposed to preside especially over the
        growth of the yams and fruit-trees. The first-fruits were presented
        to them. A little of the new fruit was laid on a stone, or on a

        few sticks lashed together with strips of bark, in the form of a
        table, with its four feet stuck in the ground. All being quiet, the

        shape, about three feet long by eighteen inches wide, set up on one
        end in the open air. Leaves of the cocoa-nut palm were tied about it,
        considerably increasing its size and height. The leaves were changed
        every month, that they might be always fresh. The worship paid to the
        god consisted in repeating prayers before the stone, and laying
        beside it a portion of the food prepared by the people for their own
        use. This they did at their daily meals, at festivals, and whenever
        they specially wished to propitiate the favour of the god. The
        first-fruits of the season were always offered to him. Every family
        of distinction had one of these stones which was considered rather in
        the light of a family altar than as an idol.<a id="noteref_978" name=

        offered to the gods in the person of the divine chief Tooitonga,
        which allotment is made once a year, just before the yams in general
        are arrived at a state of maturity; those which are used in this
        ceremony being planted sooner than others, and, consequently, they
        are the first-fruits of the yam season. The object of this offering
        is to insure the protection of the gods, that their favour may be

        of the ceremony approaches, it becomes more frequent, so that the
        people of almost every plantation sound the conch three or four
        times, which, breaking in upon the silence of the night, has a
        pleasing effect, particularly at Vavaoo, where the number of woods
        and hills send back repeated echoes, adding greatly to the effect.
        The day before the ceremony the yams are dug up, and ornamented with
        a kind of ribbon prepared from the inner membrane of the leaf of a
        species of pandanus, and dyed red....</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The sun has scarcely set when the sound of the conch
        begins again to echo through the island, increasing as the night
        advances. At the Mooa [capital] and all the plantations the voices of
        men and women are heard singing <span class=

        the first part of the sentence, and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        four hours, and again increases as the sun rises. Nobody, however, is
        seen stirring out in the public roads till about eight o'clock, when
        the people from all quarters of the island are seen advancing towards
        the Mooa, and canoes from all the other islands are landing their
        men; so that all the inhabitants of Tonga seem approaching by sea and
        land, singing and sounding the conch. At the Mooa itself the
        universal bustle of preparation is seen and heard; and the different
        processions entering from various quarters of men and women, all
        dressed up in new <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gnatoos</span></span>, ornamented with red
        ribbons and wreaths of flowers, and the men armed with spears and
        clubs, betoken the importance of the ceremony about to be performed.
        Each party brings in its yams in a basket, which is carried in the
        arms with great care by the principal vassal of the chief to whom the
        plantation may belong. The baskets are deposited in the <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Mooa</span></span>), and some of them begin to
        employ themselves in slinging the yams, each upon the centre of a
        pole about eight or nine feet long, and four inches diameter. The
        proceedings are regulated by attending matabooles.<a id="noteref_980"
        name="noteref_980" href="#note_980"><span class=

        yams being all slung, each pole is carried by two men upon their
        shoulders, one walking before the other, and the yam hanging between
        them, ornamented with red ribbons. The procession begins to move
        towards the grave of the last Tooitonga (which is generally in the
        neighbourhood, or the grave of one of his family will do), the men
        advancing in a single line, every two bearing a yam, with a slow and
        measured pace, sinking at every step, as if their burden were of
        immense weight. In the meantime the chiefs and matabooles are seated
        in a semicircle before the grave, with their heads bowed down, and
        their hands clasped before them.”</span> The procession then marched
        round the grave twice or thrice in a great circle, the conchs blowing
        and the men singing. Next the yams, still suspended from the poles,
        were deposited before the grave, and their bearers sat down beside
        them. One of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">matabooles</span></span> of Tooitonga now
        addressed the gods generally, and afterwards particularly, mentioning
        the late Tooitonga, and the names of several others. He thanked them
        for their divine bounty in favouring the land with the prospect of so
        good a harvest, and prayed that their beneficence might be continued
        in future. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg
        381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        When he had finished, the men rose and resumed their loads, and after
        parading two or three times round the grave, marched back to the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">malái</span></span>, singing and blowing the
        conchs as before. The chiefs and <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">matabooles</span></span> soon followed to the
        same place, where the yams had been again deposited. Here the company
        sat down in a great circle, presided over by Tooitonga. Then the
        other articles that formed part of the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Inachi</span></span> were brought forward,
        consisting of dried fish, mats, etc., which, with the yams, were
        divided into shares. About a fourth was allotted to the gods, and
        appropriated by the priests; about a half fell to the king; and the
        remainder belonged to Tooitonga. The materials of the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Inachi</span></span> having been carried away,
        the company set themselves to drink <span class=

        that the gods would protect them, and grant them long lives, if they

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief
        solemnity of the Natchez, an Indian tribe on the Lower Mississippi,
        was the Harvest Festival or the Festival of New Fire. When the time
        for the festival drew near, a crier went through the villages calling
        upon the people to prepare new vessels and new garments, to wash
        their houses, and to burn the old grain, the old garments, and the
        old utensils in a common fire. He also proclaimed an amnesty to
        criminals. Next day he appeared again, commanding the people to fast
        for three days, to abstain from all pleasures, and to make use of the
        medicine of purification. Thereupon all the people took some drops
        extracted from a root which they called the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“root of blood.”</span> It was a kind of plantain and
        distilled a red liquor which acted as a violent emetic. During their
        three days' fast the people kept silence. At the end of it the crier
        proclaimed that the festival would begin on the following day. So
        next morning, as soon as it began to grow light in the sky, the
        people streamed from all quarters towards the temple of the Sun. The
        temple was a large building with two doors, one opening to the east,
        the other to the west. On this morning the eastern door of the temple
        stood open. Facing the eastern door was an altar, placed so as to
        catch the first beams of the rising sun. An image of a <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chouchouacha</span></span> (a small marsupial)
        stood upon the altar; on its right was an image of a rattlesnake, on
        its left an image of a marmoset. Before these images a fire of oak
        bark burned perpetually. Once a year only, on the eve of the Harvest
        Festival, was the sacred flame suffered to die out. To the right of
        the altar, on <span class="tei tei-q">“this pious morn,”</span> stood
        the great chief, who took his title and traced his descent from the
        Sun. To the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg
        383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        left of the altar stood his wife. Round them were grouped, according
        to their ranks, the war chiefs, the sachems, the heralds, and the
        young braves. In front of the altar were piled bundles of dry reeds,
        stacked in concentric rings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The high priest,
        standing on the threshold of the temple, kept his eyes fixed on the
        eastern horizon. Before presiding at the festival he had to plunge
        thrice into the Mississippi. In his hands he held two pieces of dry
        wood which he kept rubbing slowly against each other, muttering magic
        words. At his side two acolytes held two cups filled with a kind of
        black sherbet. All the women, their backs turned to the east, each
        leaning with one hand on her rude mattock and supporting her infant
        with the other, stood in a great semicircle at the gate of the
        temple. Profound silence reigned throughout the multitude while the
        priest watched attentively the growing light in the east. As soon as
        the diffused light of dawn began to be shot with beams of fire, he
        quickened the motion of the two pieces of wood which he held in his
        hands; and at the moment when the upper edge of the sun's disc
        appeared above the horizon, fire flashed from the wood and was caught
        in tinder. At the same instant the women outside the temple faced
        round and held up their infants and their mattocks to the rising
        sun.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great chief
        and his wife now drank the black liquor. The priests kindled the
        circle of dried reeds; fire was set to the heap of oak bark on the
        altar, and from this sacred flame all the hearths of the village were
        rekindled. No sooner were the circles of reeds consumed than the
        chief's wife came forth from the temple and placing herself at the
        head of the women marched in procession to the harvest fields,
        whither the men were not allowed to follow them. They went to gather
        the first sheaves of maize and returned to the temple bearing them on
        their heads. Some of the sheaves they presented to the high priest,
        who laid them on the altar. Others they used to bake the unleavened
        bread which was to be eaten in the evening. The eastern door of the
        sanctuary was now closed, and the western door was opened.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the day began
        to decline, the multitude assembled once more at the temple, this
        time at its western gate, where they formed a great crescent, with
        the horns turned toward the west. The unleavened bread was held up
        and presented to the setting sun, and a priest struck up a hymn in
        praise of his descending light. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Shropshire, where the corn-spirit is conceived in the form of a
          gander (see above, vol. i. p. 407), the expression for overthrowing
          a load at harvest is <span class="tei tei-q">“to lose the

          laid the blame on the latter. Perhaps the knife alone was
          condemned. That the King Archon (on whom see above, vol. i. p. 7),

          spring and autumn festivals of Isis at Tithorea geese and goats
          were thrown into the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign"

          removed and buried at a certain spot a little way from the temple.
          Pausanias, x. 32, 14 (9). This analogy supports the view that the
          pigs thrown into the caverns at the Thesmophoria were left there

          Osiris took place. Each man slew a pig before his door, then gave

          From Mr. Grout's description it appears that a bull is killed and
          its gall drunk by the king and people. In killing it the men must
          use nothing but their naked hands. The flesh of the bull is given
          to the boys to eat what they like and burn the rest; the men may
          not taste it. As a final ceremony the king breaks a green calabash
          in presence of the people, <span class="tei tei-q">“thereby
          signifying that he opens the new year, and grants the people leave
          to eat of the fruits of the season.”</span> If a man eats the new
          fruits before the festival, he will die or is actually put to

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The ancients were at least familiar
          with the practice of sacrificing images made of dough or other
          materials as substitutes for the animals themselves. It was a
          recognised principle that when an animal could not be easily
          obtained for sacrifice, it was lawful to offer an image of it made
          of bread or wax. Servius on Virgil, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aen.</span></span>
          ii. 116. (Similarly a North-American Indian dreamed that a
          sacrifice of twenty elans was necessary for the recovery of a sick
          girl; but the elans could not be procured, and the girl's parents
          were allowed to sacrifice twenty loaves instead. <span class=

          Jesuites</span></span>, 1636, p. 11, ed. 1858). Poor people who
          could not afford to sacrifice real animals offered dough images of
          them. Suidas, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          bakers made a regular business of baking cakes in the likeness of
          all the animals which were sacrificed to the gods. Proculus, quoted

          procure a black cow to sacrifice at the rites of Proserpine, they
          made a cow of dough and placed it at the altar. Plutarch,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          sacrifice to Hercules, in place of the ram which was the proper
          victim, an apple was regularly substituted, four chips being stuck
          in it to represent legs and two to represent horns. Pollux, i. 30

          getting them does not contradict the view suggested in the text. It
          may be a way of transmitting the bones to the spirit-land. The
          aborigines of Australia burn the bones of the animals which they
          eat, but for a different reason; they think that if an enemy got
          hold of the bones and burned them with charms, it would cause the
          death of the person who had eaten the animal. <span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">It seems to be a common custom with
          hunters to cut out the tongues of the animals which they kill.
          Omaha hunters remove the tongue of a slain buffalo through an
          opening made in the animal's throat. The tongues thus removed are
          sacred and may not touch any tool or metal except when they are
          boiling in the kettles at the sacred tent. They are eaten as sacred
          food. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Indian bear-hunters cut out what they call the bear's little tongue
          (a fleshy mass under the real tongue) and keep it for good luck in
          hunting or burn it to determine from its crackling, etc., whether
          the soul of the slain bear is angry with them or not. Kohl,

          184. In folk-tales the hero commonly cuts out the tongue of the
          wild beast which he has slain and preserves it as a token. The
          incident serves to show that the custom was a common one, since
          folk-tales reflect with accuracy the customs and beliefs of a
          primitive age. For examples of the incident, see Blade,

          cutting out of the tongues is a precaution to prevent the slain
          animals from telling their fate to the live animals and thus
          frightening away the latter. At least this explanation harmonises
          with the primitive modes of thought revealed in the foregoing
          customs.</dd>

          describes what seems to be a sacrament of the Abghazses (Abchases).
          It takes place in the middle of autumn. A white ox called Ogginn
          appears from a holy cave, which is also called Ogginn. It is caught
          and led about amongst the assembled men (women are excluded) amid
          joyful cries. Then it is killed and eaten. Any man who did not get
          at least a scrap of the sacred flesh would deem himself most
          unfortunate. The bones are then carefully collected, burned in a
          great hole, and the ashes buried there.</dd>

          "tei tei-q">“hunting of the wren”</span> may be compared with a
          Swedish custom. On the 1st of May children rob the magpies' nests
          of both eggs and young. These they carry in a basket from house to
          house in the village and show them to the housewives, while one of
          the children sings some doggerel lines containing a threat that, if
          a present is not given, the hens, chickens, and eggs will fall a
          prey to the magpie. They receive bacon, eggs, milk, etc., upon
          which they afterwards feast. L. Lloyd, <span class=

          customs to the <span class="tei tei-q">“swallow song”</span> and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“crow song”</span> of the ancient Greeks
          (on which see Athenaeus, pp. 359, 360) is obvious and has been
          remarked before now. Probably the Greek swallow-singers and
          crow-singers carried about dead swallows and crows or effigies of
          them. In modern Greece it is said to be still customary for
          children on 1st March to go about the streets singing spring songs
          and carrying a wooden swallow, which is kept turning on a cylinder.

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Such are the Bohemian processions at
          the Carnival when a man called the Shrovetide Bear, swathed from
          head to foot in peas-straw and sometimes wearing a bear's mask, is
          led from house to house. He dances with the women of the house, and
          collects money and food. Then they go to the alehouse, where all
          the peasants assemble with their wives. For at the Carnival,
          especially on Shrove Tuesday, it is necessary that every one should
          dance, if the flax, the corn, and the vegetables are to grow well.
          The higher they leap the better will be the crops. Sometimes the
          women pull out some of the straw in which the Shrovetide Bear is
          swathed, and put it in the nests of the geese and fowls, believing
          that this will make them lay well. Reinsberg-Düringsfeld,

          Cuzco; according to Molina there were four hundred. Acosta's

          Possibly this case belongs more strictly to the class of mediate
          expulsions, the devils being driven out upon the car. Perhaps,
          however, the car with its contents is regarded rather as a bribe to
          induce them to go than as a vehicle in which they are actually
          carted away. Anyhow it is convenient to take this case along with
          those other expulsions of demons which are the accompaniment of an
          agricultural festival.</dd>

          Yet both state that it occurs in the fourth month of the year.
          According to Pallegoix (i. 253) the Siamese year is composed of
          twelve lunar months, and the first month usually begins in
          December. Hence the expulsion of devils would commonly take place

          Amongst the Chukmas of South-east India the body of a priest is
          conveyed to the place of cremation on a car; ropes are attached to

          of this sort are instituted for a different purpose. In some East
          Indian islands when the people want a rainy wind from the west, the
          population of the village, men, women, and children, divide into
          two parties and pull against each other at the ends of a long
          bamboo. But the party at the eastern end must pull the harder, in
          order to draw the desired wind out of the west. Riedel,

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">In the Dassera festival, as celebrated
          in Nepaul, we seem to have another instance of the annual expulsion
          of demons preceded by a time of licence. The festival occurs at the
          beginning of October and lasts ten days. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“During its continuance there is a general holiday
          among all classes of the people. The city of Kathmandu at this time
          is required to be purified, but the purification is effected rather
          by prayer than by water-cleansing. All the courts of law are
          closed, and all prisoners in jail are removed from the precincts of
          the city.... The Kalendar is cleared, or there is a jail-delivery
          always at the Dassera of all prisoners.”</span> This seems a trace
          of a period of licence. At this time <span class="tei tei-q">“it is
          a general custom for masters to make an annual present, either of
          money, clothes, buffaloes, goats, etc., to such servants as have
          given satisfaction during the past year. It is in this respect, as
          well as in the feasting and drinking which goes on, something like
          our <span class="tei tei-q">‘boxing-time’</span> at
          Christmas.”</span> On the seventh day at sunset there is a parade
          of all the troops in the capital, including the artillery. At a
          given signal the regiments commence firing, the artillery takes it
          up, and a general firing goes on for about twenty minutes, when it
          suddenly ceases. This probably represents the expulsion of the
          demons. <span class="tei tei-q">“The grand cutting of the
          rice-crops is always postponed till the Dassera is over, and
          commences all over the valley the very day afterwards.”</span> See
          the description of the festival in Oldfield's <span class=

          functions of the Salii or dancing priests, who during March went up
          and down the city dancing, singing, and clashing their swords
          against their shields (Livy, i. 20; Plutarch, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Numa</span></span>,
          13; Dionysius Halicarn. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Antiq.</span></span> ii. 70) may have been to
          rout out the evils or demons from all parts of the city, as a
          preparation for transferring them to the scapegoat Mamurius
          Veturius. Similarly, as we have seen (above, p. <a href="#Pg194"
          class="tei tei-ref">194</a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>), among the Iroquois, men in
          fantastic costume went about collecting the sins of the people as a
          preliminary to transferring them to the scapegoat dogs. We have had
          many examples of armed men rushing about the streets and houses to
          drive out demons and evils of all kinds. The blows which were
          showered on Mamurius Veturius seem to have been administered by the
          Salii (Servius on Virgil, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Aen.</span></span> vii. 188; Minucius Felix,

          Mars</span></span>, p. 49). The reason for beating the scapegoat
          will be explained presently. As priests of Mars, the god of
          agriculture, the Salii probably had also certain agricultural
          functions. They were named from the remarkable <em class=

          which they made. Now dancing and leaping high are common

          the fields at the spring or autumn sowing, or at both? The dancing
          processions of the Salii took place in October as well as in March
          (Marquardt, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          in spring and autumn (Columella, ii. 9, 6 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>) In
          their song the Salii mentioned Saturnus or Saeturnus the god of
          sowing (Festus, p. 325, ed. Müller. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Saeturnus</span></span> is an emendation of
          Ritschl's. See Wordsworth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Fragments and Specimens of Early
          Latin</span></span>, p. 405). The weapons borne by the Salii, while
          effective against demons in general, may have been especially
          directed against the demons who steal the seed corn or the ripe
          grain. Compare the Khond and Hindoo Koosh customs described above,
          p. <a href="#Pg173" class="tei tei-ref">173</a>. In Western Africa
          the field labours of tilling and sowing are sometimes accompanied
          by dances of armed men on the field. See Labat, <span class=

          all the instruments of the city continually sounding and making
          merry. They also have ten or twelve men clothed like devils, and
          these unite in making great rejoicing with the players on the
          instruments, in order that the devil may make that rice very
          productive.”</span> Varthema, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          to the sword-dancers of northern Europe has been pointed out by K.
          Müllenhoff, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ueber den Schwerttanz,”</span>
          in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Festgaben für Gustav Homeyer</span></span>
          (Berlin, 1871). In England the Morris Dancers who accompanied the
          procession of the plough through the streets on Plough Monday (the
          first Monday after Twelfth Day) sometimes wore swords (Brand,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Popular
          Antiquities</span></span>, i. 505, Bohn's ed.), and sometimes they
          <span class="tei tei-q">“wore small bunches of corn in their hats,
          from which the wheat was soon shaken out by the ungainly jumping
          which they called dancing.... Bessy rattled his box and danced so
          high that he showed his worsted stockings and corduroy
          breeches.”</span> Chambers, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Book of Days</span></span>, i. 94. It is to be
          observed that in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of
          Misrule,”</span> who reigned from Christmas till Twelfth Night (see
          Brand, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Popular Antiquities</span></span>, i. 497
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>), we have a clear trace of
          one of those periods of general licence and suspension of ordinary
          government which so commonly occur at the end of the old year or
          beginning of the new one in connection with a general expulsion of
          evils. The fact that this period of licence immediately preceded
          the procession of the Morris Dancers on Plough Monday seems to
          indicate that the functions of these dancers were like those which
          I have attributed to the Salii. But the parallel cannot be drawn
          out here. Cp. meantime Dyer, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          (in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          Analogy suggests that at Rome the Saturnalia, which fell in
          December when the Roman year began in January, may have been
          celebrated in February when the Roman year began in March. Thus at
          Rome, as in so many places, the public expulsion of evils at the
          New Year would be preceded by a period of general licence, such as
          the Saturnalia was. A trace of the former celebration of the
          Saturnalia in February or the beginning of March may perhaps be
          seen in the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          round the waist and neck; an old woman or a little child occupies
          the lower floor of the cage: and the confinement lasts only a
          month. Probably the long period mentioned by Mr. Brown is that
          prescribed for chiefs' daughters. Poor people could not afford to
          keep their children so long idle. This distinction is sometimes
          expressly stated; for example, among the Goajiras of Colombia rich
          people keep their daughters shut up in separate huts at puberty for
          periods varying from one to four years, but poor people cannot
          afford to do so for more than a fortnight or a month. F. A. Simons,

          This was perhaps a modification of the Melanesian custom of
          secluding girls at puberty. The reason mentioned by Mr. Williams,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to improve her complexion,”</span> can

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">This interpretation of the custom is
          supported by the fact that beating or scourging is inflicted on
          inanimate objects expressly for the purpose indicated in the text.
          Thus the Indians of Costa Rica hold that there are two kinds of
          ceremonial uncleanness, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nya</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span>. Anything that has been
          connected with a death is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nya</span></span>.
          But <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> is much more virulent.
          It can not only make one sick but kill. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The worst <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> of all is that of a
          young woman in her first pregnancy. She infects the whole
          neighbourhood. Persons going from the house where she lives carry
          the infection with them to a distance, and all the deaths or other
          serious misfortunes in the vicinity are laid to her charge. In the
          old times, when the savage laws and customs were in full force, it
          was not an uncommon thing for the husband of such a woman to pay
          damages for casualties thus caused by his unfortunate wife....
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Bu-ku-rú</span></span> emanates in a variety
          of ways; arms, utensils, even houses become affected by it after
          long disuse, and before they can be used again must be purified. In
          the case of portable objects left undisturbed for a long time, the
          custom is to beat them with a stick before touching them. I have
          seen a woman take a long walking stick and beat a basket hanging
          from the roof of a house by a cord. On asking what that was for, I
          was told that the basket contained her treasures, that she would
          probably want to take something out the next day, and that she was
          driving off the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span>. A house long unused
          must be swept, and then the person who is purifying it must take a
          stick and beat not only the movable objects, but the beds, posts,
          and in short every accessible part of the interior. The next day it
          is fit for occupation. A place not visited for a long time or
          reached for the first time is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span>. On our return from the
          ascent of Pico Blanco, nearly all the party suffered from little
          calenturas, the result of extraordinary exposure to wet and cold
          and want of food. The Indians said that the peak was especially
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span>, since nobody had ever
          been on it before.”</span> One day Mr. Gabb took down some dusty
          blow-guns amid cries of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> from the Indians. Some
          weeks afterwards a boy died, and the Indians firmly believed that
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> of the blow-guns had
          killed him. <span class="tei tei-q">“From all the foregoing, it
          would seem that <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> is a sort of evil
          spirit that takes possession of the object, and resents being
          disturbed; but I have never been able to learn from the Indians
          that they consider it so. They seem to think of it as a property
          the objects acquires.”</span> W. M. Gabb, <span class=

          other folk-tales. A prince or princess is shut up for safety in a
          tower and makes his or her escape by scraping a hole in the wall
          with a bone which has been accidentally conveyed into the tower;
          sometimes it is expressly said that care was taken to let the
          princess have no bones with her meat. Hahn, <span class=

          we should infer that it is a rule with savages not to let women
          handle the bones of animals during their monthly seclusions. We
          have already seen the great respect with which the savage treats
          the bones of game (see above, p. <a href="#Pg116" class=
          "tei tei-ref">116</a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>); and women in their
          courses are specially forbidden to meddle with the hunter or
          fisher, as their contact or neighbourhood would spoil his sport
          (see below, p. <a href="#Pg238" class="tei tei-ref">238</a>
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>) In folk-tales the hero who
          uses the bone is sometimes a boy; but the incident might easily be
          transferred from a girl to a boy after its real meaning had been
          forgotten. Amongst the Hare-skin Indians a girl at puberty is
          forbidden to break the bones of hares. Petitot, <span class=

          Rica eat no salt, speak as little as possible, light no fires, and
          stay strictly indoors, or if they go out during the day they

          to go on pilgrimage, whereby people learn many secret things and
          know what is to happen in the coming year. As a preparation for
          this pilgrimage, <span class="tei tei-q">“some secrete themselves
          for three days previously in a dark cellar, so as to be shut out
          altogether from the light of heaven. Others retire at an early hour
          of the preceding morning to some out-of-the way place, such as a
          hayloft, where they bury themselves in the hay, that they may
          neither hear nor see any living creature; and here they remain, in
          silence and fasting, until after sundown; whilst there are those
          who think it sufficient if they rigidly abstain from food on the

          inverting their true relation to each other. After showing that the
          essential features of the myth of the marriage of Mars and Nerio
          have their counterpart in the marriage customs of peasants at the
          present day, he proceeds to infer that these customs are the

          prehistoric times the oak appears to have been the chief tree in
          the forests which clothed the valley of the Po; the piles on which
          the pile villages rested were of oak. W. Helbig, <span class=

          his enemies in a box. While the soul is in the box, the boy is
          dead; when it is taken out, he is restored to life. In the same
          poem (p. 384) the soul of a horse is kept shut up in a box, because
          it is feared the owner of the horse will become the greatest hero
          on earth. But these cases are, to some extent, the converse of
          those in the text.</dd>

          the weapons and of the mistletoe at Balder and the blindness of
          Hödur who slew him remind us of the custom of the Irish reapers who
          kill the corn-spirit in the last sheaf by throwing their sickles
          blindfold at it. (See above, vol. i. p. 339). In Mecklenburg a cock
          is sometimes buried in the ground and a man who is blindfolded
          strikes at it with a flail. If he misses it, another tries, and so
          on till the cock is killed. Bartsch, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sagen, Märchen und
          Gebräuche aus Mecklenburg</span></span>, ii. 280. In England on
          Shrove Tuesday a hen used to be tied upon a man's back, and other
          men blindfolded struck at it with branches till they killed it.

          Mannhardt (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>) has made it probable that
          such sports are directly derived from the custom of killing a cock
          upon the harvest-field as a representative of the corn-spirit (see
          above, p. <a href="#Pg009" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>). These
          customs, therefore, combined with the blindness of Hödur in the
          myth suggest that the man who killed the human representative of
          the oak-spirit was blindfolded, and threw his weapon or the
          mistletoe from a little distance. After the Lapps had killed a
          bear—which was the occasion of many superstitious ceremonies—the
          bear's skin was hung on a post, and the women, blindfolded, shot
          arrows at it. Scheffer, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

              the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h2>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>
